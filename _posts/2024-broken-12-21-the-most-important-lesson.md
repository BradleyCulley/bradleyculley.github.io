"Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It’s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It’s round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you’ve got a hundred years here. There’s only one rule that I know of, babies-"God damn it, you’ve got to be kind."
-Kurt Vonnegut, from the novel God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater (https://redtreetimes.com/2020/05/22/welcome-to-earth)

The problem with that is that it gives primacy to other people's emotional needs

The reality of the world is that most people aren't that kind and kindness is a sort of sloppy emotion that you can't really count on

That's not a normative statement. In fact I wish the world were otherwise.
It's a descriptive statement: how the world works.

And so what I propose here as the most important lesson is more basic than something like "you've got to be kind".

The most important lesson is to never be powerless.

It's protecting yourself first before trying to go solve the needs of everyone else.
That's not to say one shouldn't try to address the needs of others, but it can't be the top priority.

You must secure your own airplane face mask before you trying to assist others with theirs

The fact of the matter is also that if you fail to protect yourself, you won't be effective in being kind to everyone else

This is just one instance in which we teach children the way we wish the world were rather than the way it actually is

And you can say more fundamentally as you might have noticed with a lot of the teachers and administrators in your life as a young person and in fact more generally those in positions of power when you're in a position of weakness they have it appears arrange the world in their own self-interest rather than in the interest of protecting you.

It's an actual scientific fact that some people's brains are organized in a manner such that they get a deposit in their emotional bank when they hurt other people.

Putting kindness into a position of primacy in your internal hierarchical representation of importance makes you a walking pin cushion to these people, and pin you they will.

Add to the most important lesson essay the point about all these speeches in the 90s and early 2000s about leadership. I'm not sure who decided leadership was the most important thing in the world but somebody did and the emphasis on it was endless. Also mention the speech the guy gave where he said you will only remember one thing from this, and that's the only thing I remember - literally him saying you'll only remember one thing.
