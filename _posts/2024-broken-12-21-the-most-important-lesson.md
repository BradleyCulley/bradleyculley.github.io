Kurt Vonnegut wrote about what he would tell a newborn child on planet Earth
He said he would tell them that you know Earth is wet and round and whatever and that you have to be kind
go look up the specific quote
The problem with that is that it gives primacy to other people's emotional needs
The reality of the world is that most people aren't that kind and kindness is a sort of sloppy emotion that you can't really count on
That's not a normative statement it's just a descriptive statement about how reality actually looks
And so what I propose here as the most important lesson is more basic it's more fundamental than something like you have to be kind
It's protecting yourself first before trying to go solve the emotional needs of everyone else
This is akin to securing your own face mask on a plane before you try to assist others with theirs
The fact of the matter is also that
if you fail to protect yourself you won't be very effective in being kind to everyone else
This is just one instance where we teach children the way we wish the world were rather than the way it actually is
And you can say more fundamentally as you might have noticed with a lot of the teachers and administrators in your life as a young person and in fact more generally those in positions of power when you're in a position of weakness they have it appears arrange the world in their own self-interest rather than in the interest of protecting you.

It's an actual scientific fact that some people's brains are organized in a manner such that they get a deposit in their emotional bank when they hurt other people.
Putting kindness into a position of primacy in your internal hierarchical representation of importance makes you a walking pin cushion to these people, and pin you they will.
