   Itâ€™s common to take on more complexity as soon as<br/> basic manageability is achieved for a given level of complexity
</div>

<br/>
For example:
1. Graduate from college/vocational training/etc. That's a high complexity-management task, but when it's done, it's done.<br><br>
2. Ramp up into a career. Another complex, difficult task. Once you're up to speed at work, though, you're up to speed at work.<br><br>
3. Once #1 and #2 are done, immediately jumping into another high-complexity situation.
For example, getting married, buying a house, going back to school part-time, or getting involved in civil society (PTA, fire department, etc).<br/><br/>
Those are all good things, but piling on complexity too quickly is a common malady.
In fact, I see some people pile on #3 while #1 is in progress.
Marriage, kids, and a mortgage while you're still in medical school? That's wild!<br>

   I think a few phenomena cause us to "take on too much":
   1. Things like going back to school are implicitly pitched as having the effect of lowering life complexity. For example, better degree equals better job.
   That's only after the fact, though. In the midst of it, they're high complexity tasks...often much higher than anticipated.<br/><br/>
   2. The mind underestimates its current level of complexity. If one actually writes down all the thing one's "managing" at a given time, it tends to be a surprisingly long list.
   Everything from semi-funky relationships to remembering to get an oil change.<br/><br/>
   3. The mind takes on new complexity as a way to distract from existing complexity. Drugs are a good example.
   I've never done drugs or alcohol, but they seem to immediately add massive life complexity.
   It would be interesting to couch things in that way talking to kids about drugs. Might be more effective than a moralizing approach.<br/><br/>
   4. Paradoxically, at times of high complexity, it's human to reach for the fixes (e.g. drugs, alcohol) that add the most complexity. Mesolimbic pathway and all that.
   There's many a tale of a person who in the same week loses their job and is diagnosed with a serious illness, and turns to the bottle to cope.
   Now that person has three problems, not two.<br><br>The alcoholism being perhaps the most complex of them all.
   Clinically, this is characterized by the Diathesis-stress model: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diathesis%E2%80%93stress_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diathesis%E2%80%93stress_model). <br/><br/>
   "Diathesis" refers to a person's innate tolerance for complexity and stress.
   In the case of the person with the bad week, the Diathesis-stress model provides the etiology of substance use disorder.
   The pathological weight of complexity itself is characterized by psychological concepts such as cognitive load and decision fatigue.<br/><br/>
   Likewise, sociologically by concepts such as role strain and role conflict. In other words, being two different people in two different areas of your life.<br/><br/>
   The brain detests complexity, that's for sure.<br/><br/>
   One other very large factor is the society into which one is embedded.<br/><br/>
   The social diathesis of The United States, for example, is very low. Of Sweden, very high.<br/><br/>
   Approximately 60% of Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck. Healthcare is tied to your job - the only industrialized nation on Earth to do so.
   Even many full-time jobs, such as at restaurants, don't offer healthcare.<br/><br/>
   If Americans seem stressed, that's why. They're one small mistake away from quite possibly literal death.
   Low diathesis. I'm continually amazed by how civil and reasonable the average American is in spite of the macroeconomic Venus Fly Trap in which they're embedded.

Years ago, I saw an interview with a man who was seeking help in life, for himself and his 3 children. I certainly felt for him and his situation.
Yet after a moment the thought came to mind: if you weren't 100% sure you could provide for your first child, why did you have the your child? Surely not the second? And a third?

Also years ago, I read a short essay by a man who had adopted a child when he was around 50 years old.
By that time, he was established in his career - as an MD/PhD oncologist, as it happened.
He was also settled into his romantic relationship with his partner. He was in excellent shape financially.<br/><br/>
In fact, he gave up one of his two roles: research or clinical medicine (I don't recall which it was) in order to spend more time with his child.
Finally, he said, there was a certain _je ne sais quois_ of groundedness that came with age. Knowing himself as a person and knowing how to interact with the world.
