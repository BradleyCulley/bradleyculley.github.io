One of my high school physics teachers was an aerospace engineer by trade.
He'd taught physics at the school full-time for years by the time I met him.

He held the rank of Colonel in the Air Force. One day, he showed us his military identification card.

He was 64 years old when I took his physics class.
He was from Huntsville, Alabama, which goes by the nickname "Rocket City" due to its history in aerospace and spaceflight.

He had worked on military aerospace projects for years before coming to our school in Northern Maine to teach physics.

In retrospect, I realize the sacrifice he was making.

Aerospace engineering as a "full bird" Air Force Colonel would have paid so much more, and garnered so much more respect.

And unlike where our school was in Northern Maine, Huntsville doesn't have snow on the ground from September to May.
Wife and three great kids. A thoroughly wonderful man.

He was my physics teacher the first half of my senior year.

After that first semester, he resigned when the economic situation of teaching, with three children to support, became too unjustified.

He gave each of us a folded postcard with a note about his resignation.

He had a standing offer to come back to Huntsville any time and work on rockets. That winter, he took the offer.


He once told us 98% of the wealth in the United States is created by engineers.
While I headed in a direction of science, rather than engineering, in college, the 98% idea stuck me with.

Science alone doesn't create wealth, any more than ideas create an essay.

Engineering bridges the gap from ideas into the real world of money, business, and human systems.

On a separate note, engineering is often the rate-limiting factor in science.
Isaac Newton could have had the <i>idea</i> of the Higgs Boson, and all the antecedent particle physics, but nobody could have run an experiment to <i>test</i> for the Higgs Boson until around 300 years after Newton died.

<p>
    The graph below, to which <a href="TODO add link to culture post">I often return in my thinking</a>, illustrates that fact.
    In particular, only one thing has inflected the curve of human prosperity: the invention of the first commercially successful steam engine, in 1712³.

The first commercially-successful steam engine was invented by Thomas Newcomen, a engineer in the iron industry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Newcomen)

#### Like a farmer

<p>
In the summer of 2009, I met an environmental engineer while doing an internship.
A nice man probably in his 50s or so; a peaceful solidity to about him.
I once read an opinion that the key thing to look for in a good person to have in your life is that they are <b>unassuming</b>.
</p>

<p>
The unassuming person is, as the saying goes, "comfortable in their own skin".
I believe most all the ills of the world come from the outward manifestations of people's internal chaos and despair.
"Projection", as they say.
</p>

<p>
That particular environmental engineer once explained that he was too old to do hands-on engineering, so he managed projects/people.
He said so without distress...more like bemusement.
</p>

<p>
About 5 years later, I was working for a software company when I first met the company president and lead programmer.
When we walked into the room, I thought "he reminds me of a farmer".
In my reckoning, farmers tend to have: rugged humility, muted self-assurance, and a permanent sense of mild frustration.
</p>

<p>
The programmer, like the farmer, deals directly with reality.
The crops don't care if you're having a bad day.
But if you do things correctly, things work.
</p>

### The Good Life

<p>
About a year and half after I graduated from college, I was doing workshares on farms in the Northeastern United States.
I would work half days in exchange for food and lodging.
One of the farms I worked on - in New Hampshire - was the home of a very very very nice husband and wife.
The wife was a retired teacher and the husband was an retired electrical engineer.
</p>

<p>
The husband had gotten both his undergraduate degree and his masters degree from MIT, as it happened.
The husband and wife had met while he was still an undergraduate, and were still married, with three successful grown-up children, about 50 years later.
They were both about as happy as a person can be in life. Great friends, a great social life, great hobbies, a beautiful house on many acres in a nice countryside town. 
</p>

<p>
They were also unbelievable good to me during my stay as their guest. I still think of them regularly.
</p>

<p>
It won't come as a surprise, then, that I remember thinking something like "hm, this is nice".
</p>

### Santiago Gonzales

<p>
In around 2013, I saw a short journalistic piece on a teenage prodigy named Santiago Gonzales.
This is the piece: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBXZWB_dNsw.
It struck some deep chord and drove me to pursue programming quite intensely.
I'd been learning and doing programming in a more passive way prior to that.
</p>

<p>
Later, I read an article in Rolling Stone Middle East about Santiago.
That article struck an even deeper chord.
One line in particular stuck with me: the journalist saying that Santiago reminded him of a description he'd read
in one of the works of Dante, of "a mind on fire with the truth".
And in particular of the experience of learning and understanding being a kind of intensely romantic experience: "intimate" and "commanding", I think were two of the words the journalist used.
</p>

### Salman Khan

(I think one of his degrees was in engineering)

### Anil Chitrakar


My advisor for my research project in Nepal: Anil Chitrakar

### In-Demand, Respected

-The treatment I heard of the engineer getting at the meeting in Nepal: probably leave that out

### Don't Become a Scientist!

<p>
I got my undergraduate degree in a pure physical science (astronomy). Why didn't I become a scientist?
</p>

<p>
In 2016, I read an essay titled "Don't Become a Scientist!", by Professor Jonathan I. Katz, professor of physics at Washington University, St. Louis, Mo.

Professor Katz wrote the article in 1999. This excerpt summarizes the essay:
> Are you thinking of becoming a scientist? Do you want to uncover the mysteries of nature, perform experiments or carry out calculations to learn how the world works? Forget it!

> Science is fun and exciting. The thrill of discovery is unique. If you are smart, ambitious and hard working you should major in science as an undergraduate. But that is as far as you should take it. After graduation, you will have to deal with the real world. That means that you should not even consider going to graduate school in science. Do something else instead: medical school, law school, computers or engineering, or something else which appeals to you.

> Why am I (a tenured professor of physics) trying to discourage you from following a career path which was successful for me? Because times have changed (I received my Ph.D. in 1973, and tenure in 1976). American science no longer offers a reasonable career path. If you go to graduate school in science it is in the expectation of spending your working life doing scientific research, using your ingenuity and curiosity to solve important and interesting problems. You will almost certainly be disappointed, probably when it is too late to choose another career.

> American universities train roughly twice as many Ph.D.s as there are jobs for them. When something, or someone, is a glut on the market, the price drops. In the case of Ph.D. scientists, the reduction in price takes the form of many years spent in ``holding pattern'' postdoctoral jobs. Permanent jobs don't pay much less than they used to, but instead of obtaining a real job two years after the Ph.D. (as was typical 25 years ago) most young scientists spend five, ten, or more years as postdocs. They have no prospect of permanent employment and often must obtain a new postdoctoral position and move every two years.

</p>

<p>
From those I know personally who have done PhDs in pure science, Professor Katz's advice rings true.
</p>



This was the thread with Ben in which I linked that article: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/physics+job+ben+brooks/FMfcgxmQJRTMbgRDxbqClXLXHJKFSsfk
That thread with Ben may be a good source of a whole new separate essay on AI, science, academia, industry, etc.

An engineer can't be said to be pushing false truths or even...more subtly...to be pushing not all that useful truths. 
I think we all know university departments that are guilty, if we're completely honest, of pushing fairly useless information.
Though of course that depends on one's definition of useless.

In common parlance we would think of someone like a priest, a monk or a pastor as being the epitome of virtue. 
But here I must say I agree with the great Nepali poet, Lakshmi Prasad devkota, who called the ascetic "a deserter".

"I see...the ascetic in his cave a deserter"

Getting literal about it The engineer is planted between heaven and earth with a certain special solidity. 

In alignment with the heavens because they use the laws of the heavens (the laws of nature), and an alignment with humanity because they straightforwardly serve humanity.

I chatted with a person who was clearly sheltered/privileged the other day.
My reaction, and my mind has always worked this way, was to think "oh so that's nice". "Oh that's quite pleasant".
When I visited Sweden, I thought "this is wonderful", not "how can I tear this down?".

I simply can't understand the mentality of those who see "privilege" and want to destroy it/tear it down/etc. My mentality it "that's quite nice, let's create that for everyone, using science and technology". 
Growth mindset versus fixed mindset. 
When I was in Sweden, almost everyone I met basically had zero emotional baggage, so far as I could tell. 
My thought was "oh this is so nice", it would be nice to make the whole world like this.
This is also why I prefer engineering to something net-zero like being a lawyer. 
Also, the density of lawyers in government is perhaps a genesis of some of our ills.

It's an irony that I hated writing as a child. I hated pretty much everything about it. The physical act of writing was painful. I had sloppy handwriting and was officially diagnosed with "disgraphia". I was given the option to complete my writing assignments on a computer. I briefly did so. An option that lasted until the first of my classmates made a remark about something like how it was "weird" I was using the computer. Back to pencil and paper I went.

I hated having to come up with idea on demand. Creativity on demand, with very fixed parameters, isn't creativity. Maybe it took ChatGPT to prove this to us. The Greeks had the notions of the gods and the muses - being struck with inspiration. Serendipity. Once we finally unravel and map the mind, we'll perhaps then understand the stochastic nature of true creativity. For now, it's a black box, having little to do with contrived, banal, circumscribed gradeschool writing prompts.

I disliked, but couldn't say quite hated, the whole aura of "writing people". They refused to think logically, straightforwardly, and in a solution-oriented manner. They had, and still have, an insufferable smugness of withering repugnancy. Go to a creative writing, literature, or theatre department. Then go to an electrical engineering department. The clearly, blatantly more intelligent, capable, society-supporting, wealth-building, true intellectuals are in nearly every case incomparably less haughty. This discongruity has been a constant tension of my life. In particular, the related question: why are dumb people seemingly always in charge?

Blog post "Why an engineer", about the various engineers I met over the years, and how they influenced me. Including:
-the environmental engineer husband in Waterville
-the materials science engineer in PA
-the electrical engineer in NH: Koerbers
-the software engineers Matt and his dad (don't use their names). Talk about how the dad had the aura of a farmer when I met him in person for the first (and only) time.
-Destin from smarter every day
-Santiago Gonzales
-Salman Khan (I think one of his degrees was in engineering)
-My advisor for my research project in Nepal: Anil Chitrakar
-The treatment I heard of the engineer getting at the meeting in Nepal: probably leave that out

Add to "why an engineer" essay: Matt from Bridgeware, and his dad (don't remember the dad's name now). Matt being a serious and kind of badass human, and the dad having the aura of a farmer when he came in the room. Honest work. Real work.

Add to "why an engineer":

Add to the essay about why an engineer The idea of someone described it to me with respect to medicine that once you learn all about the body and body systems and disease and you perform dissections of you know cadavers you kind of have this feeling where it's like well okay that's it that's the story that there's that there's no other piece there's no kind of magical piece

And you kind of get to the end of this profession and you feel something like a strange combination of exhaustion and relief it's kind of like looking back at high school you go okay yeah I went through these different grades but there was nothing magical that happened when I got to the next grade it's kind of more the same it was reality it was the world it was like people so there's something similar that happens with professions when you get deep into object-oriented programming or networking or infrastructure or type safety type systems do at some point understand how they work and in a way it's both adenoma and a eureka because you feel the sort of you you experience kind of the intellectual splendor of the system of the intellectual framework that built all this up and of all the millions of hours of people working on it and making it all work and figuring it all out but on the
other hand the magic is gone and a literal sense there's no piece that's missing anymore or that some mysterious I should say not missing mysterious is that word

I once heard a police officer described who had retired describe he was you know in his civilian car he had already retired and he saw a police car you know drive through with their I think you know lights on siren and he he said he immediately in simultaneously thought three different things it was either two or three two that I remember are I hope he's safe or you know I hope he's careful the cop that he saw and then I think this the second one was I used to do that and the third thing that he thought was it doesn't matter

Add to the why an engineer post that the arguably the best and most important philosopher of the 20th century Ludwig-Fitkinstein was an engineer first and it was in fact his sense of returning to the solidity of engineering and the practicality of engineering that drove the main arcs of his philosophical investigations and research and ideas conceptions

Maybe include:
Something I noticed as well is that major breakthroughs in medical research is surprising number of them are done by MD's rather than PhDs and I think that may be because they're close to the problem and they see it earlier practical point of view so an example would be kind of the head of the development of the HIV vaccine Dr David Ho and the head of the development of the salt polio vaccine Jonas sulk and also the doctor at OHSU I forgot his name

Without overgeneralizing, the Wright Brothers were bicycle mechanics, and so on

Add to the y in engineer the experience of the building that flashcards application in Binghamton and how I had the list of things and then I wrote the code and it worked and nobody could stop me so to speak from getting it done and getting exactly the outcome I wanted which is not something I was getting very much of at that point in life

Add to the wine engineer post that a lot of people get into software engineering I sort of a fallback thing or because they have a lack of imagination and it seemed like a stable high paying career or because their parents told them to. Or remember once talking to someone who is doing chemical engineering who said they wish they'd done computer science because that was like the number one best salary in lowest unemployment rate. It wasn't like that at all for me. It was more like a burning passionate tumultuous falling into love. Talk about the knights coating in Binghamton and the moment I learned about custom constructors in enumerated types in Java. I think it's can be considered strange to Love something as abstract as computer programming. But if you think about it with a person you love a concept that you hold of that person not necessarily the person at a cellular level or even
necessarily exactly who they really are. You have what in your algebra's called a projection of that person that perhaps emphasizes the parts that you love. And so similarly I don't think it's so strange to love a concept such as the symmetry or elegance of computer programming or it will engineered system.

Add to the food web essay the phenomenon of seen on occasion of the extremely pious squared away well behaved almost unsettlingly well behaved child. The parent kind of both puts them in a bubble and heavily guides them in a direction of sort of almost caricature-esque levels of good behavior. When I see that I tend to think "That bubble will burst". I think it would be much preferable to guide the child in the direction of generally good behavior but also but also infuse them more with the real world. Cite The essay by that Ben guy about the golden necklace with the bite marks in it.

Add the Niel Armstrong or whomever it was piece about being a pocket protected nerdy engineer 

Add to the why an engineer the idea of engineers not being valued in American culture, but that that's not true and all cultures. For example the conversation I had with the French guy. Talk about the The dorm room I had at mssm with no windows and the way the heat was out from time to time 

Talk about how there are movies and television shows and so on about heroic doctors teachers firefighters police officers coal miners truck drivers chefs and cooks small business owners (always hearing about how great they are) lawyers soldiers politicians and various other professions, in mainstream American culture. The only such piece of media that comes to mind with respect to engineers is the television show silicon valley which is extremely insulting to engineers and paints them as socially clumsy dumb nerds. Is perhaps no wonder that China, and other countries, are eating our lunch with respect engineering. It's worth noting that there are there are films in television shows about malevolent actors in certain professions as well. For example malevolent investment bankers (the big short ) or businesspeople (Erin brockovich, which by the way portrays a heroic lawyer), but I can't
think of such media in which the subject is engineers. In other words, the cultural relationship with engineers doesn't even rise to the level of a love-hate relationship. Rather, engineers are pretty much culturally invisible. When's the last time you saw a civil engineer interviewed on television? It's an odd choice to ignore such a key dynamo in the engine of economic prosperity. 

October sky is perhaps a rare exception (and a great film), but it touches extremely lightly upon the details of engineering, whereas, for example, House MD has no problem throwing lots of medical jargon into the show

Add to the wine engineer essay the idea of "the more complex the tools". In college I noticed that courses that required calculus is a prerequisite were actually easier general Lee significantly easier than courses the did not. The reason I believe is that the course is that did not needed to sort of prove to themselves that they were intellectually rigorous and tough. I remember hearing that the drawing 101 class was like a nightmare. To draw so much stuff your fingers were practically gonna fall apart and the professor was unbelievably tough and imperious and then flexible and almost borderline mean. Meanwhile my professor for modern physics in which we learned some special relativity quantum mechanics and various other things was the nice world and he brought us soda and chips on the last day. The answered a random question they had about solar panel wattage the very same day that they know the tone even though it had nothing to do with the clas really. He also played us somewhere over the rainbow by dropping pieces of wood sequentially on top of the lectern for the class, Annie lettuce guess which song it was. This was particularly salient for me because I was taking differential equations multivariable calculus modern physics and so on at the same time that I was taking requiring classes in things like the English department that were you know and so-called social sciences and I noticed that the wrapping of the social science classes were so much more complicated but it occurred to me that it was and then necessary kind of complexity. Insert into the SA here by the way some excerpts from some BS social science paper and then from a physics book. Talk about Casey neistat the videographer and about how he basically had to work every waking second of the day in order to differentiate himself and become successful as the person making YouTube videos, vs a software engineer or a surgeon let's say you basically just have to do the job and in fact I've worked with multiple people over the years who basically didn't didn't even do that and managed to sort of hide in plain sight and never really write much code or get much done whatsoever and they still didn't get fired as programmers. This never been me for the record but it happens all the time. My father had open heart surgery in the year 2000 and the surgeon objectively completely screwed it up he didn't suture meaning stitch the valve together properly which is one of like the most important key main things he had to do. We didn't see him or anything and he continued on his life being an open heart surgeon. My father then had two more open heart surgeries in which the doctor screwed up multiple other things and misdiagnosed various things and cut a section out of his chest in a mistaken effort to fix something that they were misunderstanding. None of them were fired or even censured or anything. The point is that the bar is much lower when the bar to entry is higher, so to speak.

Add to the y& engineer essay experiences of writing code in every minute my free time and Binghamton. Including the one day where I didn't leave the apartment and basically didn't do anything else and how it was utterly sublime.
