One of my high school physics teachers was an aerospace engineer by trade.
He'd taught physics at the school full-time for years by the time I met him.

He held the rank of Colonel in the Air Force. One day, he showed us his military identification card.

He was 64 years old when I took his physics class.
He was from Huntsville, Alabama, which goes by the nickname "Rocket City" due to its history in aerospace and spaceflight.

He had worked on military aerospace projects for years before coming to our school in Northern Maine to teach physics.

In retrospect, I realize the sacrifice he was making.

Aerospace engineering as a "full bird" Air Force Colonel would have paid so much more, and garnered so much more respect.

And unlike where our school was in Northern Maine, Huntsville doesn't have snow on the ground from September to May.
Wife and three great kids. A thoroughly wonderful man.

He was my physics teacher the first half of my senior year.

After that first semester, he resigned when the economic situation of teaching, with three children to support, became too unjustified.

He gave each of us a folded postcard with a note about his resignation.

He had a standing offer to come back to Huntsville any time and work on rockets. That winter, he took the offer.


He once told us 98% of the wealth in the United States is created by engineers.
While I headed in a direction of science, rather than engineering, in college, the 98% idea stuck me with.

Science alone doesn't create wealth, any more than ideas create an essay.

Engineering bridges the gap from ideas into the real world of money, business, and human systems.

On a separate note, engineering is often the rate-limiting factor in science.
Isaac Newton could have had the <i>idea</i> of the Higgs Boson, and all the antecedent particle physics, but nobody could have run an experiment to <i>test</i> for the Higgs Boson until around 300 years after Newton died.

    The graph below, to which <a href="TODO add link to culture post">I often return in my thinking</a>, illustrates that fact.
    In particular, only one thing has inflected the curve of human prosperity: the invention of the first commercially successful steam engine, in 1712³.

That work was done by Thomas Newcomen, a engineer in the iron industry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Newcomen)

#### Like a farmer

An engineer can't be said to be pushing false truths or even...more subtly...to be pushing not all that useful truths. 
I think we all know university departments that are guilty, if we're completely honest, of pushing fairly useless information.
Though of course that depends on one's definition of useless.

In common parlance we would think of someone like a priest, a monk or a pastor as being the epitome of virtue. 
But here I must say I agree with the great Nepali poet, Lakshmi Prasad devkota, who's called the ascetic "a deserter".
<add quote from the poem here>

Getting literal about it The engineer is planted between heaven and earth with a certain special solidity. 
In alignment with the heavens because they use the laws of the heavens the laws of nature, and an alignment with humanity because they do work that unequivocally serves humanity.

I chatted with a person who was clearly sheltered/privileged the other day. My reaction was to think "oh that's nice"/"that's quite pleasant". I simply can't understand the mentality of those who see "privilege" and want to destroy it/tear it down/etc. My mentality it "that's quite nice, let's create that for everyone, using science and technology". Growth mindset versus fixed mindset. When I was in Sweden, almost everyone I met basically had zero emotional baggage, so far as I could tell. My thought was "oh this is so nice", it would be nice to make the whole world like this. This is also why I prefer engineering to something net-zero like being a lawyer. Also, the density of lawyers in government is perhaps a genesis of some of our ills.

It's an irony that I hated writing as a child. I hated pretty much everything about it. The physical act of writing was painful. I had sloppy handwriting and was officially diagnosed with "disgraphia". I was given the option to complete my writing assignments on a computer. I briefly did so. An option that lasted until the first of my classmates made a remark about something like how it was "weird" I was using the computer. Back to pencil and paper I went.

I hated having to come up with idea on demand. Creativity on demand, with very fixed parameters, isn't creativity. Maybe it took ChatGPT to prove this to us. The Greeks had the notions of the gods and the muses - being struck with inspiration. Serendipity. Once we finally unravel and map the mind, we'll perhaps then understand the stochastic nature of true creativity. For now, it's a black box, having little to do with contrived, banal, circumscribed gradeschool writing prompts.

I disliked, but couldn't say quite hated, the whole aura of "writing people". They refused to think logically, straightforwardly, and in a solution-oriented manner. They had, and still have, an insufferable smugness of withering repugnancy. Go to a creative writing, literature, or theatre department. Then go to an electrical engineering department. The clearly, blatantly more intelligent, capable, society-supporting, wealth-building, true intellectuals are in nearly every case incomparably less haughty. This discongruity has been a constant tension of my life. In particular, the related question: why are dumb people seemingly always in charge?

Blog post "Why an engineer", about the various engineers I met over the years, and how they influenced me. Including:
-the environmental engineer husband in Waterville
-the materials science engineer in PA
-the electrical engineer in NH: Koerbers
-the software engineers Matt and his data (don't use their names). Talk about how the dad had the aura of a farmer when I met him in person for the first (and only) time.
-Destin from smarter every day
-Santiago Gonzales
-Salman Khan (I think one of his degrees was in engineering)
-My advisor for my research project in Nepal: Anil Chitrakar
-The treatment I heard of the engineer getting at the meeting in Nepal: probably leave that out

Add to "why an engineer" essay: Matt from Bridgeware, and his dad (don't remember the dad's name now). Matt being a serious and kind of badass human, and the dad having the aura of a farmer when he came in the room. Honest work. Real work.

Add to the essay about why an engineer The idea of someone described it to me with respect to medicine that once you learn all about the body and body systems and disease and you perform dissections of you know cadavers you kind of have this feeling where it's like well okay that's it that's the story that there's that there's no other piece there's no kind of magical piece

And you kind of get to the end of this profession and you feel something like a strange combination of exhaustion and relief it's kind of like looking back at high school you go okay yeah I went through these different grades but there was nothing magical that happened when I got to the next grade it's kind of more the same it was reality it was the world it was like people so there's something similar that happens with professions when you get deep into object-oriented programming or networking or infrastructure or type safety type systems do at some point understand how they work and in a way it's both adenoma and a eureka because you feel the sort of you you experience kind of the intellectual splendor of the system of the intellectual framework that built all this up and of all the millions of hours of people working on it and making it all work and figuring it all out but on the
other hand the magic is gone and a literal sense there's no piece that's missing anymore or that some mysterious I should say not missing mysterious is that word

I once heard a police officer described who had retired describe he was you know in his civilian car he had already retired and he saw a police car you know drive through with their I think you know lights on siren and he he said he immediately in simultaneously thought three different things it was either two or three two that I remember are I hope he's safe or you know I hope he's careful the cop that he saw and then I think this the second one was I used to do that and the third thing that he thought was it doesn't matter

Add to the why an engineer post that the arguably the best and most important philosopher of the 20th century Ludwig-Fitkinstein was an engineer first and it was in fact his sense of returning to the solidity of engineering and the practicality of engineering that drove the main arcs of his philosophical investigations and research and ideas conceptions

Maybe include:
Something I noticed as well is that major breakthroughs in medical research is surprising number of them are done by MD's rather than PhDs and I think that may be because they're close to the problem and they see it earlier practical point of view so an example would be kind of the head of the development of the HIV vaccine Dr David Ho and the head of the development of the salt polio vaccine Jonas sulk and also the doctor at OHSU I forgot his name

Without overgeneralizing, the Wright Brothers were bicycle mechanics, and so on

Add to the y in engineer the experience of the building that flashcards application in Binghamton and how I had the list of things and then I wrote the code and it worked and nobody could stop me so to speak from getting it done and getting exactly the outcome I wanted which is not something I was getting very much of at that point in life

Add to the wine engineer post that a lot of people get into software engineering I sort of a fallback thing or because they have a lack of imagination and it seemed like a stable high paying career or because their parents told them to. Or remember once talking to someone who is doing chemical engineering who said they wish they'd done computer science because that was like the number one best salary in lowest unemployment rate. It wasn't like that at all for me. It was more like a burning passionate tumultuous falling into love. Talk about the knights coating in Binghamton and the moment I learned about custom constructors in enumerated types in Java. I think it's can be considered strange to Love something as abstract as computer programming. But if you think about it with a person you love a concept that you hold of that person not necessarily the person at a cellular level or even
necessarily exactly who they really are. You have what in your algebra's called a projection of that person that perhaps emphasizes the parts that you love. And so similarly I don't think it's so strange to love a concept such as the symmetry or elegance of computer programming or it will engineered system.

Add to the food web essay the phenomenon of seen on occasion of the extremely pious squared away well behaved almost unsettlingly well behaved child. The parent kind of both puts them in a bubble and heavily guides them in a direction of sort of almost caricature-esque levels of good behavior. When I see that I tend to think "That bubble will burst". I think it would be much preferable to guide the child in the direction of generally good behavior but also but also infuse them more with the real world.

Add the Niel Armstrong or whomever it was piece about being a pocket protected nerdy engineer
