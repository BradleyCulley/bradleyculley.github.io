One of my high school physics teachers was an aerospace engineer by trade.

He held the rank of Colonel in the Air Force, and once showed us his military identification card.

He was 64 years old when I took his physics class.
He was from Huntsville, Alabama, and had worked on military aerospace projects before coming up to Northern Maine to teach.
It's only in retrospect that I realize how much of a sacrifice he was making to teach us.
Aeorspace engineering as a "full bird" Colonel would have paid so much more.
And being honest, he would have garnered much more respect as a Colonel aerospace engineer.
Also, in Huntsville, unlike in northern Maine, there wasn't snow on the ground from September to May.
A wonderful man.
He was my physics teacher the first half of my senior year, and had taught at the school for years prior.
After that first semester, he resigned when the economic situation of teaching, with three children to support, became too unjustified.
He gave each of us a folded postcard with a note about his resignation.
He'd had an open offer to come back to Huntsville any time and work on rockets, which he took.


He once told us 98% of the wealth in the United States is created by engineers.
While I headed in a direction of science in college, that thought always stuck me with.
Science alone doesn't create wealth, any more than ideas create an essay.
One needs to bridge the gap from ideas into the real world and real economy.
Furthermore, engineering is often the rate-limiting factor in science.
Isaac Newton could have had the <i>idea</i> of the Higgs Boson (and all the antecedent particle physics), but it wouldn't have been testable until around 300 years after he died.

    The graph below, to which <a href="TODO add link to culture post">I often return in my thinking</a>, illustrates that fact.
    In particular, only one thing has inflected the curve of human prosperity: the invention of the first commercially successful steam engine, in 1712³.

That work was done by Thomas Newcomen, a engineer in the iron industry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Newcomen)

An engineer can't be said to be pedaling false truths or even to be peddling not all that useful truths. 
In common parlance we would think of someone like a priest, a monk or a pastor as being the epitome of virtue. 
But here I must say I agree with Lakshmi Prasad devkota, who's called the ascetic a deserter. 
Getting literal about it The engineer is planted between heaven and earth with a certain special solidity. 
In alignment with the heavens because they use the laws of the heavens the laws of nature, and an alignment with humanity because they do work that unequivocally serves humanity.
