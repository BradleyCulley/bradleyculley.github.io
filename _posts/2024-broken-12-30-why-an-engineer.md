An engineer can't be said to be pedaling false truths or even to be peddling not all that useful truths. In common parlance we would think of someone like a priest, a monk or a pastor as being the epitome of virtue. But here I must say I agree with Lakshmi Prasad devkota, who's called the ascetic a deserter. Getting literal about it The engineer is planted between heaven and earth with a certain special solidity. In alignment with the heavens because they use the laws of the heavens the laws of nature, and an alignment with humanity because they do work that unequivocally serves humanity.
