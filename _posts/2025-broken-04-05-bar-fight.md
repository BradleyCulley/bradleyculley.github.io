### Bar Fight

<p>I'm 36 years old and I've never gotten in a bar fight where someone smashed a beer bottle over my head</p>

<p>I've also never smashed a beer bottle over someone else's head in a bar fight</p>

<p>I've never had someone at a bar disrespect the woman I was there with, and so more or less obligating me to fight the individual in question</p>

<p>I've never accidentally bumped into someone at a bar and had them refuse to accept my apology, and then had the whole situation continue to escalate until I was more or less obligated to fight the individual in question</p>

<p>I've never had someone spill their drink on me (or my female partner) at a bar and therefore was more or less obligated to fight the drink-spiller</p>

<p>All of these situations I've avoided with a single technique: not going out drinking at bars</p>
