### The Most Important Thing In The World

<b>"The most important thing in the world is culture, because only with a good culture can we enjoy all of the good things that are available to us" - Joscha Bach</b>

<p>
    I often come back to a conversation I heard years ago, between Dr. Joscha Bach, a German artificial intelligence researcher and cognitive scientist, and the AI model GPT-3.
    Dr. Bach has prompted GPT-3 to answer as though it were Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the famous 18th and 19th century German intellectual.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Bach:</b><br/>
    "The world is full of good things, and we can't experience them all.
    We have to choose a few, and the problem is that we chose the wrong ones.
    But then again, it's not our fault: we had no other choice."<br/><br/>
    <b>Goethe:</b><br/>
    "What can we do about it? We can only change the culture."<br/><br/>
    <b>Bach:</b><br/>
    "Johann, I agree. The most important thing in the world is culture, because only with a good culture can we enjoy all of the good things that are available to us".<br/><br/>
    <b>Goethe:</b><br/>
    "Then let's begin to create a new culture."
</p>

<b>Culture is the root</b>
<p>
    I used to think technological innovation is the key to a better society.
    If we made a better microchip or a new vaccine, things would be good.
    I still think it's part of the puzzle, but it's not at the root.
</p>

<p>
    Technology is nothing to sneeze at.
    Only one event in history has truly changed the course of human prosperity: the invention of the steam engine, in [[add date for its invention, and a citation]]

    As an adult, I saw that despite incredible innovation in medicine, people suffer and die from uncomplicated diseases, including here in The United States.
</p>

<p>
    So what's the wealth and technology worth if you have an underclass teeming with problems, the solutions to which are already known, and already implemented among the middle class and the wealthy?
    Technology, entrepreneurship, and wealth are necessary, but not sufficient.
</p>

<p>
    In 2011, the state of Vermont passed H.202, resulting in single-payer (a.k.a. completely government-funded) healthcare for Vermont residents.
    It never made it out of the planning stages. 
    "As of January 2013, Vermont was still working out the role of Green Mountain Care and the responsibilities of the bill, as well as how to fund the program." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_health_care_reform
    A year later, the bill was dead:
    "As of April 2014, Vermont had yet to craft a bill that would address the $2 billion in extra spending necessary to fund the single-payer system, and by the end of the year, the state abandoned their plan for universal health care, citing the taxes required of smaller businesses within the state." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_health_care_reform
    In other words, "I, as a business owner, would have to spend money on <span style="font-style: italic;">poor people?</span>".
</p>

<p>
    American culture is quite individualistic. It's not selfish - far from it - but it's individualistic.
    Pass all the laws you want: culture is more fundamental than the law.
</p>

<p>
    "
    But then I tell them, "If you think a bill of rights is what sets us apart,
    you’re crazy." Every banana republic in the world has a bill of rights. Every
    president for life has a bill of rights. The bill of rights of the former evil
    empire, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, was much better than ours.
    I mean it literally. It was much better. We guarantee freedom of speech and
    of the press. Big deal. They guaranteed freedom of speech, of the press, of
    street demonstrations and protests, and anyone who is caught trying to suppress criticism of the government will be called to account. 
    Whoa, that is  wonderful stuff!
    " - Former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia

<p>
    The reason Nordic prisons are humane is not that there's this law or that law stating they ought to be, nor even that they're well-funded.
    They're humane because the society around them is humane. It's the culture.
</p>

<b>What is culture?</b>
<p>
    Culture is often associated with its externalities: food, language, religion, special dances, special rituals, cool hats.
    But it's what in mathematics is called a set of axiomatic invariants.
    That's the stuff so fundamental (when you grow up in the culture) that it seems obvious.
</p>

<p>
    A good framework for this is "Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory", created by Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede.
    Here are the 5 dimensions in his theory, plotted for a few countries:

    <div align="center">
      <img style="height: 80vh;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/Hofstede_4_countries_6_dimensions.png" />
    </div>

    As you can see, the United States has a score of 91 in the "invididualism" dimension.
    That particular graph only shows 4 countries, but in Hofstede's full analysis, the United States scored the highest in individualism among every country in the world. 
    That was the hitch with Green Mountain Care.
</p>

<p>
    A culture need not be in one-to-one association with a nation.
    Every family has a culture.
    So does every town, school, and even every interpersonal relationship.
</p>

<p>
    Culture is often ostensibly consequentialist: "fermented food is good for you".
    While it can have consequentialist ramifications, it's fundamentally deontological: "I like this vibe".
</p>

<b>The most important thing in the world</b>
<p>
    You can't be completely civilized, or expect a completely civilized experience, in a larger culture that is uncivilized.
    Try being "Mr. Nice Guy" in prison.
    I see people in the United States endlessly trying to circumvent this.
    Trying to create the perfect bubble.
    Then they have a crazy neighbor who throws beer cans into their yard.
    Or their teenage child gets tangled up in drugs.
</p>

<p>
    I've noticed that people who've found happiness in life have typically "found their tribe" and become part of the "Inner Ring" within that tribe, to use CS Lewis' excellent term (https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring).
    Military veteran, tenured professor, respected senior vice president, grandmother with a big and loving extended family.
    I cite these unironically, by the way.
</p>

<p>
    Because it's the most important thing in the world, people will do nearly anything for culture.
    A demonstration of this is The United States' various failed attempts at nation-building abroad.
    People would rather have no government, or a disfunctional government, than a culturally-foreign government.
    The US-backed government collapses as soon as the US leaves. Pretty simple: they never wanted it.

    Paul Erdős was a famous mathematician who led an unusual life.
    He was homeless, a bachelor with no children, and owned only what he could carry in a suitcase.
    He traveled from mathematical event to mathematical event, staying in the homes of other mathematicians, who hosted him.
    Beyond the biological basics, he really only had the culture of professional mathematics and his well-respected position within it.
    He was happy as a clam. 
</p>

<b>Culture is the refined product</b>
<p>
    In manufacturing, you start with raw materials and end with a finished product.
    In life, we have different social and professional roles: teacher, soldier, doctor.
    Many of them are, albeit in sophisticated ways, fighting entropy.
    Why bother? Why exist? Why do anything?
</p>

<p>
    The medieval French built beautiful cathedrals.
    A cathedral - the physical embodiment of a cultural motif - is a metaphor for what's always happening in a culture.
    Cultures aim to convert the raw materials of human effort into certain refined cultural edifices in physical, emotional, and intellectual space.
</p>
<p>
    The "refined product", then, is the aesthetic, or to use a colloquial term, the vibe.
    It's like dinner with your extended family: the food and the restaurant aren't the point.
    The point is the vibe, effulgent in emotional space.
</p>

<b>Teleology</b>
<p>
    If you pick a random Wikipedia page and click the first link that's not pronunciation-related, then click the first link on the page it takes you to, and continue this procedure, you eventually end up on the Wikipedia page for "Philosophy".
    It all points back to philosophy.
    Philosophy feels like the wrong term for the vibe of a family dinner, but it's in a more everyday sense.
</p>

<p>
    The philosophical term for "refined product" is teleology: the end goal.
    So that's the answer to the question of "why do anything?".
    It's for the vibe of it.
</p>

<b>How do we change the culture?</b>
<p>
    In Bach's words: "What can we do about it? We can only change the culture."
    Ok, so how do we change the culture?
</p>

<p>
    In my opinion, this was solved by the 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume.
    He had an oddly specific answer: "the public intellectual".
    Hume distinguished between the academic philosopher, cloistered in an ivory tower, and the public intellectual, who out of both inclination and necessity makes their work palatable and interesting for everyday people.
    Some famous public intellectuals: Buddha, Jesus, Confucius, Noam Chomsky, Carl Sagan, Ayn Rand, Andreĭ Sakharov, Hannah Arendt, Albert Einstein, and Joan of Arc.
</p>

<p>
    Culture is upstream of everything else, and public intellectuals create the culture.
    Beyond the biological basics, public intellectuals create the software we run.
    Public intellectual is on a gradient: each of us can be a public intellectual somehow.
    We can shape the culture in our family or workplace, perhaps.
</p>

<p>
    Years ago, I saw a question in an online forum: "which profession has had the greatest impact on the world?".
    Politician, explorer, scientist.
    One of the answers made the case for "the amateur philosopher", otherwise known as the public intellectual.
</p>

Beyond the biological basics, the public intellectuals create the software we're all running.
The rest of everything is downstream from the cultural motifs they create and/or promote.

It's not a simple linear correlation with wealth, either. The United States is the richest country in the world, yet has horrifying prisons, and mass incarceration.
I've spoken with many Finns over the years; not one has bragged about their prisons, but they rightfully could.

So back to what culture is: culture is bedrock truths.
Often so presuppositional as to be more or less literally unspoken.




I've noticed that solving the big problems of a society is often couched in the framework of left/right politics.
Or worse yet, American left/right politics. Clearly, if one or the other was the solution, you'd just implement that and be done with the whole thing.
Problems solved. But is Louisiana a utopia?
Is Venezuela a utopia? Maybe it's more complicated than that. 

I'm often reminded of the president of Denmark saying Denmark is not a socialist country.
It's confusing to people who are so reductive in their thinking that they must couch everything in these left/right political terms. 
"Ok so Denmark is left-wing and that's the solution, right?" No, it's _the culture_.

"I know that some people in the US associate the Nordic model with some sort of socialism. 
Therefore I would like to make one thing clear. Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. 
Denmark is a market economy." - Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Prime Minister of Denmark (https://www.thelocal.dk/20151101/danish-pm-in-us-denmark-is-not-socialist)





When people speak of culture, they're often talking about _their_ culture, with the implicit assumption that it's "the best".
.

Or, more annoyingly perhaps, if you didn't adhere to their culture (because they don't want you muddying it up), but rather just went ahead and recognized that it's the best of all possible cultures and really ought to be revered as such.

This is particularly commonly applied in terms of the parts of a given culture that mentioned above: food, language, religion, etc.
People _really_ want you to just go ahead and amit their food is better, and if we're being honest, is "the best".

But I say forget the special foods, the rituals, the music; show me your prisons.


Some examples which are common, but importantly, have not been uniformly true across time and place:
-We don't murder people
-All people have equal human rights
-<add some more>

For example:
-Justice must be served through a legal process/alternatives to a legal process: blood feuds, guilty until proven innocent, etc.
-Might makes right/tall poppy syndrome
-Hierarchy is good/hierarchy is bad
-Be direct/be indirect

I tend to think of countries and cultures in terms of their prisons.
Prisons reveal a culture for what it truly is.
It's the same as watching your date interact with the waiter at a restaurant.
They reveal behavior towards those in positions of relative powerlessness.
If he's a jerk to the waiter but nice to you, odds are he'll be a jerk to you if you lose your job and get cancer...because you'll no longer have anything he wants.

Hume himself was such a public intellectual: https://youtu.be/HS52H_CqZLE?si=vWyk8XRVA1agcwZJ

<add the point about Filipino culture: cite the article about percentage of people who feel loved.
Note how I felt this gravitational pull, so to speak, with talking with most Filipinos, that there were trying to find some way to, in a platonic sense at least, love me.
And I must say, it's quite nice. I enjoy talking with Filipinos.>

A friend of mine from China once told me about the levels of underground housing in some Chinese cities.
You literally live in a cage, into which you lock yourself at night, to avoid being robbed or assaulted.
There are no fire alarms or fire suppression systems. When fires break out, people are burned alive.
<include a link to a source on the underground networks for living.

One can't legislate away poverty.
Cue images of Hugo Chavez pointing at things and saying <insert what he said: "nationalize it"?>.

Legislation is a relevant tool, but the problem isn't legislative.
Nor is raw wealth the solution .

<Insert quote from Confucius about the layers of society, and them being in good order. Note that I quote him unironically, and greatly admire his thinking, and that it's a pet peeve that he's often quoted ironically in the West>.

It's possible to be wealthy and uncivilized, both at a societal level and at a personal level.
We've all met rich people who are pretty nutty.
Societies and governments can be wealthy, yet unfair, brutal, and corrupt.


A few years ago, I had surgery on my foot. The surgery was performed in central Illinois, a politically conservative part of the world.
So anyway, a few months after the surgery, I experienced what turns out to be a very common complication of that particular procedure.
I went back to the doctor and presented my malady.
He promptly dismissed it as nothing, said he "didn't know what to do" and roundly dismissed me, both literally and figuratively.
I sought a second opinion, who imm


“A people can never choose between different types of government.
It can choose the outer trappings of government, but not the essential thing, the spirit of government—even though public opinion constantly confuses the two.
What gets written into a constitution is never essential.
The important thing is how the instinct of the people interprets it.”
― Oswald Spengler, Prussianism and Socialism

I once read a description of US Healthcare as being like a Rolls Royce. Packed with features, absolutely top-of-the-line, the best money can buy. And almost no one can afford it.

When I studied abroad in Senegal, one of the Senegalese lecturers spoke about religion during one of his lectures.
He explained religion in Senegal as something like this: <draw a diagram with Islam, etc. above, and a box all the way across the bottom for "animism">. You could draw a similar diagram for American politics, with left/right above, and individualism below (<link to Overindividualism post>): <include the drawing>. That's culture.

    A few years ago, I started own software engineering consultancy business.
    I purchased my health insurance through healthcare.gov, the health insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
    I didn't qualify for a discounted price though, because my income was too high.
    I paid full price for my plan and thought nothing of it: just a way to find, compare, and purchase plans.
    Nearly very doctor I saw during the year or so I had that health insurance plan asked me what my job was, even when it was clearly medically irrelevant.
</p>


<p>
    The irony is I was earning around $75+/hr, had around 10 years of full-time experience as an engineer, was creating economic value out of nothing (creating a business), have a STEM degree from a very fancy university, etc.
    I also received clearly substandard discriminatory medical care.
    They just saw a guy on welfare, though I wasn't.
    So that's the moral of the story: pass all the laws you want - culture is much more fundamental.

    Prisons are good at demonstrating bedrock cultural truths.
    "The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons" -https://bigthink.com/words-of-wisdom/fyodor-dostoevsky-you-can-just-a-society-by-entering-its-prisons/
    Prisons reveal the true cultural attitude towards those in a position of relative powerlessness.
    "Of course prisoners get abused. If you don't want to get abused, don't go to prison!". Have you heard that before?
</p>

Political opinion: the primary reason that the United States doesn't have single-payer health insurance is not that it's too large (China has it) nor too heterogeneous (cosmopolitan nations such as The UK, Ireland, and Brazil have it). It's because of high individualism.
Was recently reading about Howard Dean's creation of a single-payer healthcare system in Vermont. It was called Green Mountain Care. It started in 2011, and was shut down in 2014. The reason: "On December 17, 2014, Vermont abandoned its plan for universal health care, citing the taxes required of smaller businesses within the state". (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_health_care_reform)
In other words, *I* will actually have to lose wealth over this. It's the same situation with housing in San Francisco or Seattle. All well and good and let's help the homeless, but when it comes down to *my* actual house might be worth less (because of de-gentrification), that's a hard stop.
This explains the housing issue in 60 seconds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=344ULCbhAsE.
The Dutch sociologist Dr. Geert Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions theory quantifies each country's culture according to 5 cultural dimensions: Power Distance Index, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance Index, and Long-Term Orientation.
The United States is #1 in the world in individualism: https://clearlycultural.com/geert-hofstede.../individualism/.
There are some other fascinating insights from Hofstede's dimensions, too. For example, the country with the highest and lowest masculinity index are Japan and Sweden, respectively. Japan regularly tortures confessions out of those accused of crimes (Hogobo, etc.: https://www.amnesty.org/.../2021/06/asa220041998en.pdf), and has a 99.9% conviction rate. Having been to Sweden, it's more or less multifactorially heaven on Earth.
In my experience, members of a culture would rather die (fight a war, etc.) than give up their culture: it's a terminal value. That's why colonialism/nation building ultimately always fails.
So that's why I think these problems aren't technical/logistical in nature, but rather culturally inherent, and therefore inherently unfixable. Or more like "wont-fixable". The solution would be to move cultures.
