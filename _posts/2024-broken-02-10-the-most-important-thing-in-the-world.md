### The Most Important Thing In The World

<b>"The most important thing in the world is culture, because only with a good culture can we enjoy all of the good things that are available to us" - Joscha Bach</b>

<p>
    I often come back to a conversation I heard years ago, between Dr. Joscha Bach, a German cognitive scientist, and the AI model GPT-3.
    Dr. Bach prompted GPT-3 to answer as though it were Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the great 18th and 19th century German intellectual.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Bach:</b><br>
    "The world is full of good things, and we can't experience them all.
    We have to choose a few, and the problem is that we chose the wrong ones.
    But then again, it's not our fault: we had no other choice."<br><br>
    <b>Goethe:</b><br>
    "What can we do about it? We can only change the culture."<br><br>
    <b>Bach:</b><br>
    "Johann, I agree. The most important thing in the world is culture, because only with a good culture can we enjoy all of the good things that are available to us".<br><br>
    <b>Goethe:</b><br>
    "Then let's begin to create a new culture."

#### Culture is the Key
<p>
    I used to think technological innovation is the key to a better society.
    If we made a better microchip or a new vaccine, things would be good.
</p>

<p>
    Only one event in history has markedly changed human prosperity: the invention of the first commercially successful steam engine, in 1712¹.
    That's what kicked off the sharp increases in this graph:
    <div align="center">
      <img style="width: 70vw;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/industrial-revolution.png" />
      <div style="font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">The graph is from a blog post titled "There was only one industrial revolution" (https://lukemuehlhauser.com/there-was-only-one-industrial-revolution). Good title.</div>
    </div>
</p>

<p>
    As an adult, I saw more clearly that despite innovation in medicine, people suffer and die from uncomplicated diseases, including here in the United States.
    Mass incarceration, mass homelessness, endless wars.
    Technology, entrepreneurship, and wealth are necessary, but not sufficient.
</p>

#### Green Mountain Care
<p>
    In 2011, the state of Vermont passed bill H.202, legislating a single-payer (completely government-funded) healthcare system for Vermont residents.
    The system was called Green Mountain Care, named after Vermont's nickname: "The Green Mountain State".
</p>

<p>
    "As of January 2013, Vermont was still working out the role of Green Mountain Care and the responsibilities of the bill, as well as how to fund the program." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_health_care_reform)
    A year later, the bill was dead.
    "As of April 2014, Vermont had yet to craft a bill that would address the $2 billion in extra spending necessary to fund the single-payer system, and by the end of the year, the state abandoned their plan for universal health care, citing the taxes required of smaller businesses within the state." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_health_care_reform)
</p>

<p>
    This was in the wealthiest country in the world, in a state (Vermont) that's in about the top third in the country for GDP per capita (data for 2014: https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/index.html?appid=70&stepnum=40&Major_Area=3&State=0&Area=XX&TableId=21&Statistic=3&Year=2014&YearBegin=-1&Year_End=-1&Unit_Of_Measure=levels&Rank=1&Drill=1&nRange=5), and, for American standards, has high state taxes, including a 6% sales tax (https://tax.vermont.gov/sites/tax/files/documents/2014IncBk-web_0.pdf).
    Vermont was also ranked the 2nd most politically-liberal state in 2014, the year the bill died, so it's not as simple as political orientation. (https://news.gallup.com/poll/181505/mississippi-alabama-louisiana-conservative-states.aspx)
</p>

<p>
    American culture is quite individualistic. It's not selfish - far from it - but it is individualistic.
    Pass all the laws you want: culture is more fundamental than the law.
</p>

<p>
    "But then I tell them, "If you think a bill of rights is what sets us apart,
    you’re crazy." Every banana republic in the world has a bill of rights. Every
    president for life has a bill of rights. The bill of rights of the former evil
    empire, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, was much better than ours.
    I mean it literally. It was much better. We guarantee freedom of speech and
    of the press. Big deal. They guaranteed freedom of speech, of the press, of
    street demonstrations and protests, and anyone who is caught trying to suppress criticism of the government will be called to account. 
    Whoa, that is  wonderful stuff!" - Former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia - https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-114sdoc12/pdf/CDOC-114sdoc12.pdf

#### Prison: A True Barometer
<p>
    <div align="center">

    On the right, the same for "Nordic Prison".
</p>

<p>
    "The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons"
    -Not Fyodor Dostoevsky
    
The above quote is often mis-attributed to Fyodor Dostoevsky (e.g. https://bigthink.com/words-of-wisdom/fyodor-dostoevsky-you-can-just-a-society-by-entering-its-prisons/), but he never said or wrote that.
It does, however, capture aspects of his thinking.

Dostoevsky was incarcerated for four years in a Siberian prison camp, and afterward wrote a semi-autobiographical book, "The House of the Dead", about life in such a place. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_the_Dead_(novel))
Here's something he actually did say, in "The House of the Dead":
"In short, the right of corporal punishment given to one man over another is one of the sores of social life, one of the strongest forces destructive of every germ, every effort in society toward civic feeling, and a sufficient cause for its inevitable dissolution." (page 186: https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_House_of_the_Dead/PVdgAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=corporal)
</p>

<p>
    The reason Nordic prisons are humane isn't that there's this law or that law stating they ought to be, nor even that the prisons are well-funded (which they are).
    They're humane because the society around them is humane.
    It's the culture.
</p>

#### What is culture?
<p>
    Culture is often framed through externalities: food, language, religion, special dances, special rituals, special hats.
    But it's actually what in mathematics is called a set of axiomatic invariants.
    It's the stuff so fundamental (when you grow up in the culture) that it seems obvious.
</p>

<p>
    A good framework for these invariants is "Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory", created by Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede.
    Hofstede's theory is the result of surveying 117,000 IBM employees across 50 countries, between 1967 and 1973. -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede%27s_cultural_dimensions_theory 
    Here are the 5 cultural dimensions in his theory, plotted for a few countries:

<div align="center">
      <img src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/Hofstede_4_countries_6_dimensions.png" style="height: 80vh;" />
</div>

As you can see, the United States has a score of 91 in the "individualism" dimension.
That particular graph only shows 4 countries, but in Hofstede's full analysis, the United States scored the highest in the world in the individualism dimension. 
Thus was the problem with Green Mountain Care.
</p>

<p>
    There's a culture to every town, school, and even every relationship between two people.
</p>

<p>
    Culture is often ostensibly consequentialist: "fermented food is good for you".
    While it can have consequentialist ramifications, it's actually deontological: "This food reminds me of my childhood. It feels like home."
</p>

#### "The most important thing in the world"
<p>
    You can't be completely civilized, or expect a completely civilized experience, in a larger culture that is uncivilized.
    Can you be "Mr. Nice Guy" in prison?
</p>

<p>
    Americans forever try to circumvent this.
    Try to create the perfect bubble.
    Then you have a neighbor who throws empty beer cans over into your yard.

    "[T]he corner-stone of the temple is not higher than the lowest stone in its foundation"

    "It was a close-knit, tiny community of Italian immigrants who had a remarkable lack of heart disease and other sickness. People in Roseto seemed to simply die of old age, while those in neighboring towns struggled with heart disease and many more health concerns." -https://www.episcopalhealth.org/leadership/roseto-connection/
    Made famous by Malcolm Gladwell's book "Outliers", 1950s Roseto Pennsylvania was a community of immigrants from Italy. -citation for Outliers
    Roseto's culture, carried over from Italy, literally made people healthier.
    "Between the family values, and the culture, there was little stress because there was an abundance of family. You weren’t without." -https://filitaliainternational.org/2018/09/roseto-effect-and-the-healing-power-of-community/

<p>
    I've noticed that people who've found happiness in life have typically "found their tribe" and become part of the "Inner Ring" within that tribe, to use CS Lewis' excellent term (https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring).
    Military veteran, tenured professor, respected senior vice president, grandparent with a big and loving extended family.
</p>

<p>
    Culture is the most important thing in the world, so people will do nearly anything for culture.
    For example, people would usually rather have a dysfunctional government, or no government at all, than a culturally-foreign government.
</p>

#### The Refined Product
<p>
    In manufacturing, you start with raw materials and end with a finished product.
    In life, we have different social and professional roles: teacher, soldier, doctor.
    Many of them are essentially fighting entropy - creating and sustaining the raw materials (people).
    But why bother? Why do anything?
</p>

<p>
    The medieval French built beautiful cathedrals.
    Cathedrals are physical reifications of abstract cultural motifs.
    Joseph Campbell called this "the hieratic pantomime, making visible on earth the forms of heaven". (TODO: citation)
    It's also a metaphor for what's always happening in a culture.
    Cultures aim to convert the raw materials of human effort into refined edifices in physical, intellectual, and emotional space.
</p>

<p>
    The refined products, then, of all human effort are the aesthetics.
    Or, to use a colloquial term, the vibes.
    At dinner with your extended family, the table, the chairs, and the food aren't the point.
    The point is the vibe, effulgent in emotional space.
</p>

#### "We can only change the culture"
<p>
    "What can we do about it? We can only change the culture."
    How do we change the culture?
</p>

<p>
    18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume had an oddly specific answer to this.
    His answer was "the public intellectual".
    Hume distinguished between the academic philosopher, cloistered in an ivory tower, and the public intellectual.
</p>

<p>
    In Hume's view, the public intellectual, out of both proclivity and necessity, makes their work palatable and interesting for everyday people.
    Some famous public intellectuals: Buddha, Jesus, Confucius, Noam Chomsky, Carl Sagan, Ayn Rand, Malcolm X, Andreĭ Sakharov, Hannah Arendt, Albert Einstein, and Joan of Arc.
</p>

<p>
    Culture is upstream of everything else, and public intellectuals create the culture.
    Public intellectual is on a gradient, by the way.
    There are varied ways to be a public intellectual - to shape a culture.
    One can influence the culture in their family or workplace, or within a whole field of work.
</p>

<p>
    Years ago, I saw a question in an online forum that went something like this: "which profession has had the greatest impact on the world?".
    Politician, explorer, scientist, etc.
    One of the answers made the case for "the amateur philosopher", otherwise known as the public intellectual.
</p>

<p>
    When Joscha Bach was asked what he finds meaningful in life, TODO: finish the quote
</p>

<b>Another Way to Change the Culture</b>
<p>
    All well and good, but are you going to <i>meaningfully</i> change the cultures that meaningfully affect you?
    Yes you can be a public intellectual, but cultural change is often gradual...glacial, even.
    Moreover, change is often bounded within a <i>sub</i>culture.
    Many have had the experience of a passing association with a well-organized, moral, pleasant institution such as a university or a good job, only to be dumped back into the real world of people wearing pajama pants at Walmart.
</p>

<p>
    Though he influenced it in a positive direction, even Carl Sagan couldn't wholly save American culture, nor even re-steer the mainstream really.
    He acknowledged this himself, in a part of his book The Demon-Haunted World in which he discusses scientists' aspirations for the 1939 New York World's Fair:  
    "However, as recounted by the historian Peter Kuznick of American University, a group of prominent scientists - including Harold Urey and Albert Einstein - advocated presenting science for its own sake, not just as the route to gadgets for sale; concentrating on the way of thinking and not just the products of science. They were convinced that broad popular understanding of science was the antidote to superstition and bigotry; that, as science popularizer Watson Davis put it, "the scientific way is the democratic way." One scientist even suggested that widespread public appreciation of the methods of science might work "a final conquest of stupidity" - a worthy, but probably unrealizable, goal." (TODO: add citation)
    "You Can't Fix Stupid"
    -Ron White (TODO add citation)
</p>

<p>
    So what's the solution?
    I suggest another interpretation of "change the culture": moving <i>oneself</i> to another culture.
    One can do both, as well: public intellectual and get out of Dodge.
</p>

    The deontological/consequentialist disconnect threw me for a major loop as a young adult.

    Paul Erdős was a famous mathematician who led an unusual life.
    He was homeless, a bachelor with no children, and owned only what he could carry in a suitcase.
    He traveled from mathematical event to mathematical event, being hosted in the homes of other mathematicians.
    Beyond the biological basics, he really only had the culture of professional mathematics and his well-respected position within it.
    He was apparently happy as a clam.

    I'm an engineer by trade.
    By analogy, we do this all the time.
    If an engineered system is broken, we often just discard it.
    Unlike science or art, we also try to avoid inventing or discovering anything new.
    If there's a solution that's known to work, we just use it.

    So what's the wealth and technology worth if you have an underclass teeming with problems, the solutions to which are known, and already implemented among the middle class and the wealthy?

<b>Teleology</b>
<p>
    If you pick a random Wikipedia page and do the following:
    1. click the first link that's not in parentheses
    2. repeat
    you eventually end up on the Wikipedia page for "Philosophy".
    Everything points back to philosophy.
    Philosophy feels like the wrong word for the vibe of a family dinner, but it's philosophy in an everyday sense.
</p>

<p>
    The philosophical term for "refined product" is teleology: the end goal.
    So that's the answer to the question of "why do anything?".
    For the vibes.
