<b>"The most important thing in the world is culture, because only with a good culture can we enjoy all of the good things that are available to us" - Joscha Bach²</b>

<p>
    I often come back to a conversation I heard years ago, between Dr. Joscha Bach, a German cognitive scientist, and the AI model GPT-3.
    Dr. Bach prompted GPT-3 to answer as though it were Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the famous 18th and 19th century German intellectual.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Bach:</b><br>
    "The world is full of good things, and we can't experience them all.
    We have to choose a few, and the problem is that we chose the wrong ones.
    But then again, it's not our fault: we had no other choice."<br><br>
    <b>Goethe:</b><br>
    "What can we do about it? We can only change the culture."<br><br>
    <b>Bach:</b><br>
    "Johann, I agree. The most important thing in the world is culture, because only with a good culture can we enjoy all of the good things that are available to us".<br><br>
    <b>Goethe:</b><br>
    "Then let's begin to create a new culture."²

#### Culture is the Key
<p>
    I used to think technological innovation is the key to a better society.
    If we made a better microchip or a new vaccine, things would be good.
</p>

<p>
    Technology's nothing to sneeze at.
    Only one historical event has truly changed the course of human prosperity: the invention of the first commercially successful steam engine, in 1712³.

      <div style="font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">From an essay titled "There was only one industrial revolution"⁴. Good title.</div>
    </div>
</p>

<p>
    Later in life, I saw, for example, that despite innovations in medicine, people suffer and die from preventable diseases, including in wealthy countries.
</p>

#### Green Mountain Care
<p>
    In 2011, the state of Vermont passed bill H.202, legislating a completely government-funded healthcare system for Vermont residents.
    The system was called "Green Mountain Care", named after Vermont's nickname: "The Green Mountain State".
</p>

<p>
    "As of January 2013, Vermont was still working out the role of Green Mountain Care and the responsibilities of the bill, as well as how to fund the program." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_health_care_reform
    A year later, in 2014, the bill was dead.
    "As of April 2014, Vermont had yet to craft a bill that would address the $2 billion in extra spending necessary to fund the single-payer system, and by the end of the year, the state abandoned their plan for universal health care, citing the taxes required of smaller businesses within the state." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_health_care_reform
</p>

<p>
    The Green Mountain Care failure happened in the wealthiest country in the world.
    It was in a state (Vermont) that's in about the top third of states for GDP per capita (data for 2014: https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/index.html?appid=70&stepnum=40&Major_Area=3&State=0&Area=XX&TableId=21&Statistic=3&Year=2014&YearBegin=-1&Year_End=-1&Unit_Of_Measure=levels&Rank=1&Drill=1&nRange=5) (https://tax.vermont.gov/sites/tax/files/documents/2014IncBk-web_0.pdf).
    Vermont was also ranked the 2nd most politically-liberal state in 2014, the year the bill died, so it's not as simple as left/right political orientation. (https://news.gallup.com/poll/181505/mississippi-alabama-louisiana-conservative-states.aspx)
    So what was the problem?
</p>

<p>
    "But then I tell them, "If you think a bill of rights is what sets us apart,
    you’re crazy." Every banana republic in the world has a bill of rights. Every
    president for life has a bill of rights. The bill of rights of the former evil
    empire, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, was much better than ours.
    I mean it literally. It was much better. We guarantee freedom of speech and
    of the press. Big deal. They guaranteed freedom of speech, of the press, of
    street demonstrations and protests, and anyone who is caught trying to suppress criticism of the government will be called to account. 
    Whoa, that is  wonderful stuff!" - Former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia -https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-114sdoc12/pdf/CDOC-114sdoc12.pdf

#### Prison: A True Barometer
<p>
    <div align="center">

    On the right, the same for "Nordic Prison".⁶
</p>

<p>
    "The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons"
    -Not Fyodor Dostoevsky
</p>

<p>
    The above quote is often mis-attributed to Fyodor Dostoevsky, but he never said or wrote that.⁷
    It does, however, capture aspects of his thinking.
</p>

<p>
    Starting in 1849, Dostoevsky was imprisoned for four years in a Siberian prison camp.
    Afterward, he wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, "The House of the Dead", about life in such a place.⁸
    Here's something he actually <i>did</i> say, in "The House of the Dead":
    "In short, the right of corporal punishment given to one man over another is one of the sores of social life, one of the strongest forces destructive of every germ, every effort in society toward civic feeling, and a sufficient cause for its inevitable dissolution."⁹
</p>

<p>
    The reason Nordic prisons are humane isn't that there's this law or that law stating they ought to be, nor even that the prisons are well-funded (which they are).
    They're humane because the society around them is humane.
    It's the culture.
</p>

#### What is culture?
<p>
    There's a culture to every town, school, and even every relationship between two people.
</p>

<p>
    Culture is often ostensibly consequentialist: "fermented food is good for you".
    While it can have consequentialist ramifications (such as universal healthcare), it's actually deontological: "This food reminds me of my childhood. It feels like home."
</p>

<p>
    Culture is often framed through externalities: food, language, religion, dances.
    It's more like air, though.
    It's the stuff so fundamental, when you grow up with it, that you don't even notice it.
</p>

<p>
    A good framework for this is "Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory", created by Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede.
    Hofstede's theory is the result of surveying 117,000 IBM employees across 50 countries, between 1967 and 1973. -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede%27s_cultural_dimensions_theory 
    These are Hofstede's 5 cultural dimensions, plotted for a few countries:
</p>

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/Hofstede_4_countries_6_dimensions.png" style="height: 80vh;" />
</div>

<p>
    As you can see, the United States has a score of 91 in the "individualism" dimension.
    That particular graph only shows 4 countries, but in Hofstede's full analysis, the United States is still the highest in the world in the individualism dimension. 
    That was the problem with Green Mountain Care: the United States is very individualistic.
</p>

#### "The most important thing in the world"
1. "Only with a good culture can we enjoy all of the good things that are available to us"
<p>
    You can't be completely civilized, or expect a completely civilized experience, in a larger culture that is uncivilized.
    Can you be "Mr. Nice Guy" in prison?
</p>

<p>
    Americans forever try to circumvent this.
    Try to create the perfect bubble.
    Then something crazy happens, and the bubble is breached.
    Your $87,000 health insurance claim gets denied.
    Your son gets addicted to heroin.

2. Mitigates the bad
<p>
    Professor James Falon was a neuroscientist at UC Irvine.
    One day, while researching brain scans of people with, and without, clinical psychopathy (antisocial personality disorder), Falon discovered a scan of his own brain had been miscategorized.

    People with psychopathy are your classic picture of "evil": remorseless, violent, uncontrollable.
    About 30% of murderers are clinical psychopaths, despite psychopaths comprising just 1% of the population. -https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/unique-everybody-else/201812/are-murderers-unfairly-labeled-psychopaths
    There are no documented cases of curing the disorder.

    The prevalence of the disorder is 10-15 times higher among prisoners than it is among the general population (2-3% versus 35% in prison).
    It's also the most common disorder among prisoners (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5742412/). -https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546673/, https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-022-03710-y

    Falon was using the scan of his own brain as an experimental control - a healthy brain.
    The scan had been classified by one of his technicians as showing the physical signs of psychopathy.
    Upon further investigation, he discovered the classification was indeed legitimate: he had the brain of a psychopath.
    
    What he didn't have was much of the typical behaviors of a psychopath.
    He was well-adjusted, professionally successful, and happily married.

    It turns out clinical psychopathy is only about 50% genetically determined.
    The other 50% is determined by the person's experiences in life, especially during childhood. (https://www.psypost.org/new-psychology-research-indicates-psychopathy-is-linked-to-social-power-and-dating-success-in-adverse-environments/, TODO find other citations).
    Dr. Falon attributed his well-adjusted life to a happy childhood.
    In other words, the culture of his early life.
</p>

3. Finding one's people
<p>
    I've noticed that people who've found happiness in life have typically "found their people" and become part of a trusted inner circle among those people.
    Tenured professor, senior vice president, grandparent with lots of offspring.
</p>

4. Defending culture
<p>
    Culture is the most important thing in the world, so people will do most anything for it.
    For example, people will generally choose a dysfunctional government, a new and unproven government, or no government at all, over a culturally-foreign government.
    Completely understandable.
</p>

<p>
    When you take a person's culture, you take their last breath - their most valuable possession.
    Communism and colonialism both do this: ban religions, ban languages, erase histories.
</p>

#### The Refined Product
<p>
    In manufacturing, you go from raw materials to a finished product.
    In life, we have different social and professional roles: father, mother, teacher, soldier, doctor.
    Curing an illness is valuable, but once the pain is gone, you're back to "square one", so to speak.
</p>

<p>
    The roles are creating and sustaining the raw materials: people.
    But why bother? Why do anything?
</p>

<p>
    The medieval French built beautiful cathedrals: physical reifications of cultural motifs.
    Joseph Campbell called such things "the hieratic pantomime, making visible on earth the forms of heaven". -The Hero with a Thousand Faces, by Joseph Campbell, page 358
    It's also a metaphor for what culture does.
    Cultures aim to convert the raw materials of human effort into refined edifices in physical, intellectual, and emotional space.
</p>

<p>
    The refined products, then, of all human effort are the aesthetics.
    Or, to use a colloquial term, the vibes.
    At dinner with your extended family, the table, the chairs, and the food aren't the point.
    The point is the vibe, effulgent in emotional space.
</p>

#### "We can only change the culture"
<p>
    "What can we do about it? We can only change the culture."
    How do we change the culture?
</p>

<p>
    18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume had an oddly specific answer to this.
    His said the way to change the culture is via being a public intellectual. -TODO add citation
    Hume distinguished between the academic philosopher, cloistered in an ivory tower, and the public intellectual.
</p>

<p>
    In Hume's view, the public intellectual, out of both proclivity and necessity, makes their work palatable and interesting for everyday people.
</p>

<p>
    Culture is upstream of everything else, and public intellectuals create the culture, so they're at the root.
</p>

<b>Another Way to Change the Culture</b>
<p>
    "You Can't Fix Stupid"
    -Ron White -https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/15169.Ron_White
</p>

<p>
    Public intellectuals can change the culture, but can you meaningfully change the cultures that meaningfully affect you?
    Can you in your lifetime?
    Cultural change is often gradual...glacial even.
    Moreover, change is often only in a <i>sub</i>culture.
</p>

<p>
    Many of us have had the experience of a passing association with a well-organized, moral, pleasant institution, such as a university or a good job, only to be dumped back into the real world.
    In the subculture, we finally had our ducks in a row. The real world was still the real world though.
</p>

<p>
    What's the solution?
    I suggest another interpretation of "change the culture": moving oneself to another culture.
    One can do both, as well: be a public intellectual and move to a culture that suits you better.
</p>

### Teleology
<p>
    The Greek philosopher Aristotle invented the idea of teleology. --Add citation
    It's a Greek word, meaning "the position that certain phenomena are best understood and explained in terms of their purposes rather than their causes." -https://www.britannica.com/topic/teleology
    Something is teleological if it's not just a means to an end, but rather an end upon itself.
    For example, one could, as Aristotle did, say that happiness is teleological. --add citation
    Happiness is valuable all by itself.

    Though he influenced it, even Carl Sagan couldn't reshape American culture.
    He kind of acknowledged this, in a part of his book The Demon-Haunted World, in which he discusses the hopes of some famous scientists for the 1939 New York World's Fair:  
    "However, as recounted by the historian Peter Kuznick of American University, a group of prominent scientists - including Harold Urey and Albert Einstein - advocated presenting science for its own sake, not just as the route to gadgets for sale; concentrating on the way of thinking and not just the products of science. They were convinced that broad popular understanding of science was the antidote to superstition and bigotry; that, as science popularizer Watson Davis put it, "the scientific way is the democratic way." One scientist even suggested that widespread public appreciation of the methods of science might work "a final conquest of stupidity" - a worthy, but probably unrealizable, goal."
