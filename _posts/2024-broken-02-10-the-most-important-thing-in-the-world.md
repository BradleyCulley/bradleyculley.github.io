<b>"The most important thing in the world is culture, because only with a good culture can we enjoy all of the good things that are available to us" - Joscha Bach²</b>

<p>
    I often come back to a conversation I heard years ago, between Dr. Joscha Bach, a German cognitive scientist, and the AI model GPT-3.
    Dr. Bach prompted GPT-3 to answer as though it were Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the famous 18th and 19th century German intellectual.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Bach:</b><br>
    "The world is full of good things, and we can't experience them all.
    We have to choose a few, and the problem is that we chose the wrong ones.
    But then again, it's not our fault: we had no other choice."<br><br>
    <b>Goethe:</b><br>
    "What can we do about it? We can only change the culture."<br><br>
    <b>Bach:</b><br>
    "Johann, I agree. The most important thing in the world is culture, because only with a good culture can we enjoy all of the good things that are available to us".<br><br>
    <b>Goethe:</b><br>
    "Then let's begin to create a new culture."²

#### Culture is the Key
<p>
    I used to think technological innovation is the key to a better society.
    If we made a better microchip or a new medication, things would be good.
</p>

<p>
    Technology's nothing to sneeze at.
    Only one thing has inflected the curve of human prosperity: the invention of the first commercially successful steam engine, in 1712³.

      <div style="font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">From an essay titled "There was only one industrial revolution"⁴. Good title.</div>
    </div>
</p>

<p>
    Later in life, I saw that technology is necessary, but not sufficient.
</p>

#### Green Mountain Care
<p>
    In March of 2011, the state of Vermont in the United States passed bill H.202, legislating a completely government-funded universal healthcare system for Vermont residents.⁵
    The system was called "Green Mountain Care", after Vermont's nickname: "The Green Mountain State".
</p>

<p>
    "As of January 2013, Vermont was still working out the role of Green Mountain Care and the responsibilities of the bill, as well as how to fund the program."⁵
    A year later, in 2014, the bill was dead.
    "As of April 2014, Vermont had yet to craft a bill that would address the $2 billion in extra spending necessary to fund the single-payer system, and by the end of the year, the state abandoned their plan for universal health care, citing the taxes required of smaller businesses within the state."⁵
</p>

<p>
    The Green Mountain Care failure happened in the wealthiest country in the world.
    In 2014, Vermont was in the top third of states for GDP per capita⁶, and had a relatively high state income tax rate⁷.
    There was also significant political will, or the bill wouldn't have materialized in the first place.
    So what was the problem?
</p>

<p>
    I believe the problem was cultural. The problem wasn't political, logistical, or even economic, as many might posit.
    The United States is quite culturally individualistic.
    Paying for someone else's healthcare isn't individualistic.
</p>

<p>
    I should note that individualism isn't the same as selfishness.
    "Per capita, Americans voluntarily donate about seven times as much as continental Europeans.
    Even our cousins the Canadians give to charity at substantially lower rates, and at half the total volume of an American household."⁸
</p>

### What is culture?
<p>
    A good framework for analyzing cultures is "Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory", created by Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede.
    Hofstede's theory is the result of surveying 117,000 IBM employees across 50 countries, between 1967 and 1973.⁹
    These are Hofstede's 5 cultural dimensions, plotted for a few countries¹⁰:
</p>

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/Hofstede_4_countries_6_dimensions.png" style="height: 80vh;" />
</div>

<p>
    As you can see, the United States has a score of 91 in the "individualism" dimension.
    The graph only shows 4 countries, but in Hofstede's full analysis, the United States still scores the highest <i>in the world</i> in individualism.¹¹
</p>

<p>
    "But then I tell them, "If you think a bill of rights is what sets us apart,
    you’re crazy." Every banana republic in the world has a bill of rights. Every
    president for life has a bill of rights. The bill of rights of the former evil
    empire, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, was much better than ours.
    I mean it literally. It was much better. We guarantee freedom of speech and
    of the press. Big deal. They guaranteed freedom of speech, of the press, of
    street demonstrations and protests, and anyone who is caught trying to suppress criticism of the government will be called to account.
    Whoa, that is  wonderful stuff!"
    <br/>-Former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia -https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-114sdoc12/pdf/CDOC-114sdoc12.pdf
</p>

<p>
    "A people can never choose between different types of government.
    It can choose the outer trappings of government, but not the essential thing, the spirit of government—even though public opinion constantly confuses the two.
    What gets written into a constitution is never essential.
    The important thing is how the instinct of the people interprets it."<br/>
    ―Oswald Spengler, Prussianism and Socialism¹²
</p>

#### Prison: A True Barometer
<p>
    <div align="center">
      <img style="width: 70vw;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/American-prison-next-to-Nordic-prison.png" />
    </div>

On the left, the first Google Image Search result for "American Prison".¹³
On the right, the same for "Nordic Prison".¹⁴
It's not about money.
</p>

<p>
    "The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons"<br/>
    <i>-Not Fyodor Dostoevsky</i>
</p>

<p>
    The above quote is often mis-attributed to Fyodor Dostoevsky, but he never said or wrote that.¹⁵
    It does capture aspects of his thinking, though.
    And while the quote is apocryphal, the idea rings true.
    Prisons unmask the true priorities of a society.
</p>

<p>
    Starting in 1849, Dostoevsky was imprisoned for four years in a Siberian prison camp.
    Afterward, he wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, "The House of the Dead", about life in such a place.¹⁶
    Here's something he <i>did</i> say, in "The House of the Dead":
    "In short, the right of corporal punishment given to one man over another is one of the sores of social life, one of the strongest forces destructive of every germ, every effort in society toward civic feeling, and a sufficient cause for its inevitable dissolution."¹⁷
</p>

<p>
    Just like the reason Green Mountain Care failed, the reason Nordic prisons are humane isn't that there's this law or that law stating that they ought to be.
    Nor are Nordic prisons humane because they're well-funded (which they are).
    They're humane because the society around them is humane.
    It's the culture.
</p>

#### What is culture?
<p>
    There's a culture to every town, school, and even every relationship between two people.
</p>

<p>
    Culture is often ostensibly consequentialist: "Fermented food is good for you".
    While it can have consequentialist ramifications (such as universal healthcare), it's actually deontological: "This food reminds me of my childhood. It feels like home."
</p>

<p>
    Culture is often framed through externalities: food, language, religion, rituals.
    It's more like air, though.
    It's the stuff so fundamental, when you grow up with it, that you don't even notice it.
</p>

#### "The most important thing in the world"
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/culture-is-the-root.png" style="height: 80vh;" />
</div>

##### 1. "Only with a good culture can we enjoy all of the good things that are available to us"
<p>
    You can't be completely civilized in a larger culture that's uncivilized.
    Can you be "Mr. Nice Guy" in a violent prison?
</p>

<p>
    Americans forever try to circumvent this. We try to create the perfect bubble.
    Then something crazy happens, and our bubble is breached.
    Your $87,000 health insurance claim gets denied.
    Your child dies of a drug overdose.
</p>

<p>
    "The corner-stone of the temple is not higher than the lowest stone in its foundation"<br/>
    <i>-Kahlil Gibran¹⁸</i>
</p>

##### 2. Finding one's people
<p>
    I've noticed that people who've found happiness in life have usually "found their people" and become part of a trusted inner circle.
    Tenured professor, senior vice president, grandparent with lots of offspring.
    They're in deep alignment with a culture.
</p>

##### 3. Defending culture
<p>
    Culture is the most important thing in the world, so people will do most anything for it.
    For example, choosing a dysfunctional government, or no government at all, over a culturally-foreign government.
    It makes sense.
</p>

<p>
    Communism and colonialism usurp culture: ban religions, ban languages, erase histories.
    When you take a person's culture, you take their last breath, their most valuable possession.
</p>

##### 4. Refined Product
<p>
    In manufacturing, you go from raw materials to a finished product.
    In life, we have various social and professional roles: parent, soldier, doctor.
    Curing an illness is valuable, but once the illness is cured, you're back to "square one".
    So why do anything? Why set the whole thing up?
</p>

<p>
    The medieval French built beautiful cathedrals: physical reifications of abstract cultural motifs.
    They poured resources into them. A cathedral doesn't mill grain or plow the fields.
    It's an end onto itself.
</p>

The report finding Georgia prisons to be in violation of the constitution:

</p>

<p>
    The average American prison, too, is a cultural motif.
    It reflects hard-nosed individualism, myopic to the social determinants of criminality, and - as described by Dostoevsky - the rippling consequences of prison brutality.
    "If you don't like it, don't go to prison", it's said.
</p>

<p>
    And so is the Nordic prison.
    Each, like The Sainte-Chapelle chapel, is luminous in reflection of certain ideals.
</p>

<p>
    Joseph Campbell called such things "the hieratic pantomime, making visible on earth the forms of heaven".²⁰
    That's a metaphor for culture.
    Cultures aim to convert the raw materials of human striving into refined edifices in physical, intellectual, and emotional space.
</p>

<p>
    The refined products, then, are the aesthetics.
    Or, you could say, the vibes.
    At dinner with your extended family, the table, the chairs, and the food aren't the point.
    The point is the vibe, effulgent in emotional space.
</p>

#### "We can only change the culture"
<p>
    "What can we do about it? We can only change the culture." How do we change the culture?
</p>

<p>
    The 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume had an oddly specific answer: be a public intellectual.
    Hume drew a distinction between the academic philosopher, cloistered in an ivory tower, and the public intellectual.
</p>

<p>
    "This is why Hume so deeply believed in the role and significance of public intellectuals.
    These were people who, unlike university professors that Hume grew to dislike immensely had to excite a passion-based attachment to ideas, wisdom, and insight.
    Only if they succeeded would they have the money to eat.
    It was for this reason that they had to write well, use colorful examples, and have recourse, wit, and charm.
    Hume's insight is that if you want to change people's beliefs, reasoning with them like a normal philosophy professor won't be the most effective strategy.
    He's pointing out that we have to try to adjust sentiments by sympathy, reassurance, good example, encouragement, and what he called art."²¹
</p>

<p>
    Culture is upstream of everything else, and public intellectuals create the culture.
    Years ago, I read an essay about which profession has had the most influence throughout history.
    It made the argument for "the amateur philosopher", also known as the public intellectual".
    From Joan of Arc to Carl Sagan.
</p>

#### Another Way to Change the Culture<
<p>
    "You Can't Fix Stupid"
    -Ron White²²
</p>

<p>
    Public intellectuals can change the culture, but can you meaningfully change the cultures that meaningfully affect you?
    In your lifetime?
    Cultural change is usually gradual. Glacial, even.
</p>

<p>
    Moreover, change is often only in a <i>sub</i>-culture.
    Many people have had the experience of a passing association with a well-organized, moral, and even pleasant institution, such as a university or a good job.
    In that subculture, the ducks were finally in a row.
    But then you're back in the real world.
</p>

<p>
    What's the solution?
    I suggest another interpretation of "change the culture": move yourself to another culture.
</p>

<p>
    And you can do both.
    You can be a public intellectual and move to a culture that better suits you.
    There's a long history of expatriate public intellectuals.
    Distance begets rational analysis, in many aspects of life.
    And you can often best effect change from outside the storm.
</p>

<p>
    There's also the idea that you "can't be in it without getting it on you".
    If you spend time in a smokey room, you'll smell like smoke.
    When I spend time with a person who grew up elsewhere, but has lived for many years in The United States, I can sort of feel its imprint on their soul.
    Bubbles don't really work.
</p>

<p>
    "He saw his ship approaching the harbour, and upon her prow the mariners, the men of his own land.<br/>
    And his soul cried out to them, and he said:<br/>
    Sons of my ancient mother, you riders of the tides,<br/>
    How often have you sailed in my dreams."<br/>
    -Kahlil Gibran²³
