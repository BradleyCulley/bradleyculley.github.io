    I got interested in Bruce Lee in around 2008.
    Honestly he's so cool it was easy to get interested.
</p>

<p>
    In the summer of 2008, I bought one of his books, <i>Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i>. 
    I have a memory of reading <i>Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i> while waiting to get a haircut on Spring Street, the main street where I went to college.
</p>

<p>
    I kind of skipped around in <i>Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i> and don't think I read every word.
    It was good though.
</p>

<p>
    It's apparently the best-selling martial arts book in the world:
    <blockquote>
    Compiled from Bruce Lee's notes and essays and originally published in 1975, Tao of Jeet Kune Do is the best-selling martial arts book in the world
    </blockquote>

</p>

<p>
Around that time, inspired by Bruce Lee, I trained for fingertips-only push-ups:

<p>
The idea of Lee's that's stayed with me the most is martial arts as a means of honestly expressing oneself.
To quote Lee:
<blockquote>
to me, ultimately martial art means honestly expressing yourself
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>
    <b>A lot of things in life are about honestly expressing yourself.</b>
    TODO: look up the studies and rework this: Dr. Gabor Maté has popularized the scientific discovery that women who express themselves, and especially, who express their anger when they experience anger, are both less likely to contract breast cancer and more likely to survive breast cancer if they do contract it.
</p>

<p>
I sometimes ask people, "are you doing any kind of creative self-expression?".
It often catches people off guard and incurs some deep thought, rather like the question "are you happy?".
</p>

<p>
I don't ask it with negative intent, though.
It's perhaps like a vitamin deficiency.
Like the taste of well-cooked spinach, you realize you'd really <i>like</i> to be <i>directly and honestly</i> expressing yourself.
</p>

<p>
    Often we settle for indirect self-expression.
    Perhaps it's via our work, our influence on our children, and so on.
    The problem is those things, while important, don't permit full artistic expressivity, exact artistic control, a guarantee the art will be experienced by others, nor a short feedback cycle with the audience.
    Painting a painting then sharing it gives you all four.

<p>
In Marcel Proust's 1,267,06-word novel, <i>In Search of Lost Time (À la recherche du temps perdu)</i>, published between 1913 and 1927, the narrator, a thinly disguised proxy of the author, searches for the meaning of life...with perhaps an oddly specific definition.
The definition is, as the title of the novel describes, to solve the problem of lost time; how to reclaim lost time.
</p>

<p>
It's a feeling many of us have experienced: years lost to bad decisions, distractions, failures, and so on.
We feel life could have gone differently; so different, so much better.
</p>

<p>
After much searching, the narrator comes to a perhaps surprising solution: art.
In particular, that one can transmute the pain of lost time through using those experiences as the basis for works of art.
An artistic alchemy of sublimation.

<blockquote>
"Returning to the prior circumstances of his life in order to translate them into a work of art is the means by which the Narrator reclaims the time lost in years gone by.
The Narrator comes to discover that time he thought wasted, in frivolous society or in love, now comes to represent the materials from which he will compose his art."
</blockquote>

That is perhaps the single most beautiful idea I have ever encountered in literature.
</p>


<blockquote>
Proust’s work is distinctively his own, but at the same time it makes visible the
conflicting mentalities that bridged the mechanization of slaughter in WWI. His work
encapsulates a range of reactions to nostalgia for a better historical moment, as well as nostalgia
for a different experience of time itself – as fulfilled and meaningful, rather than the site of
incomprehensible losses. Proust’s lesson is that art must replace god as the force that answers our
fundamental human problems. Our wanting must take the form of desire, because only desire
allows the artist to fully subsume his object in the pursuit of a mode of representation that can
respond to the terror of dying. Proust’s work experiments with the precariousness of love, but
finds it intolerable – the border that enables love’s joy yawns too darkly with the inevitable
death. Although Proust’s friendships and his reactions to contemporary political events indicate
that he privileged trust and human kindness in his life, how his aesthetic conclusions belie the
same desirous nostalgic force that drove the history of the 20th century.

    Coming back to Bruce Lee, Bruce Lee succeeded wonderfully in genuinely expressing himself.
    Lee had a positive authenticity that I think people could sense immediately.
    In the interview with Pierre Berton referenced above, for example, you can sort of feel Berton sensing and appreciating Lee's authenticity, and showing Lee authenticity and respect in return.
    --TODO: watch the full interview, and add a link to the full interview, which is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk1lzkH-e4U
</p>

<p>

</p>
    To me, Lee also is a fine example of the concomitance of philosophical ideation and concrete implementation.
    In ideation, he took formal courses in philosophy at the University of Washington, and studied various intellectual topics in a wide-ranging manner on his own.
    In implementation, he put those ideas into practice as art: films, poetry, books, and martial arts.
</p>

<p>
Jeet Kune Do is his own martial art, and philosophy, that he created out of both his learnings and his practical experimentations.
--TODO: add the note here about the other martial arts and/or ideas that influenced Jeet Kune Do
Tao of Jeet Kune Do has both philosophical abstractions and combat concretions, such as diagrams of actual physical stances and movements to employ in a fight.
TODO: add an example of such a diagram, which I had in my book review on Facebook
</p>

<p>
While best known for martial arts and films, Lee was multifactorially extraordinarily impressive.
He was a true artist.
His Daughter Shannon Lee said "He did write poetry; he was really the consummate artist." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee
He acted in dozens of successful films, starting from early in childhood, yet avoided the typical curse of childhood stardom.
He was a serious practical combat fighter, and also a great family man - well-remembered by his wife, for example.
--TODO find sources for him being well-remembered by his wife, daughter, son, and/or any other family members that have spoken about the matter
</p>

<p>
As a serious fighter, he was a boxing champion in Hong Kong as a young man.
For a while during his youth, he became involved in gang-related conflicts.
As part of one such conflict, he beat another man so badly in a street fight that he knocked one of the guy's teeth out.
</p>

<p>
Notably, however, he exited the gang life, and street fighting, and focused on what were ultimately peace-building activities, such as philosophy, art, and self-improvement.
This gets to a core idea of why we tend to admire people: those who have power but don't abuse it.
Any schmoe can be peaceful, but it's different when someone turns from violence to peace, especially when they're still quite capable of violence.
"A poet with a warrior's spirit inside" -TODO find the song that comes from
</p>

<p>
A possible commonality between philosophy and combat is essentialism.
A street fight gets to some core aspects of human, and even animal, nature.


Likewise, if you continually click the first link on Wikipedia, you almost always eventually end up on the page for philosophy, no matter where you start.
See this for a fascinating explanation of the "Wikipedia link rule" about philosophy: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-llumS2rA8I)
</p>

<p>
Philosophy is a Greek word, meaning "love of knowledge", or "love of wisdom". -https://www.etymonline.com/word/philosophy
It's the only field of study whose name speaks to love.
In other words, it's something essential, valuable in and of itself, and so you do it because you love it.
</p>


In other words you study or practice all the other subjects because they have some instrumental value, such as chemistry has an instrumental value,
And well you may find or discover a love of chemistry it's perhaps actually philosophy that you're discovering with in chemistry and what you really love is the knowledge or the wisdom that you see in a way through a lens of love in chemistry.
But philosophy is entirely about the love knowledge or wisdom.

Bruce Lee also understood and put into practice the essential importance of family. Accounts he had great relationships with both his wife and her son and both of them remember him fondly and speak well of him.

This photo of Bruce Lee in his casket that has really stayed with me: TODO add photo (https://i0.wp.com/.../2015/11/Brucelee11-Khurki.net_.jpg...). All of that ambition and discipline and drive and talent and energy and good character were simply gone, without reason.

I once heard an interview where the person, speaking of mind uploading, said that in the future we'll look back at the current era with astonishment. The era in which we carried around something as precious as our entire mind in this biological vessel - subject to innumerable, and sometimes unexpected, risks of complete loss. We do better with our hard drives.

Nonexistence is perhaps especially incongruous and inexplicable when someone young dies so suddenly. Even more so when they're a great person, like Bruce Lee. Oumou Sangare has a song title that captures this well: [Saa Magna - "Death is Terrible"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_YyroDeZrY).

Rather than focus on the tragedy of his early death, perhaps it's best to focus on how thoughtful, deep, and self-disciplined he was — to be able to identify, and so profoundly fulfill, such essential aspects of life within his short time on this planet.
