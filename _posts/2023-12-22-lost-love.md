<p><b>Culture shock is less about what's different than about what's absent</b></p>
<p>This experience makes real the seemingly tiresome academic notion that human values are culturally constructed.</p>
<p>The ancient Romans practiced human sacrifice through bloodsport at The Colosseum. An estimated 400,000 people were murdered at the Colosseum in Rome, over about 350 years.² It was considered completely normal, but feels otherworldly now.</p>
<p>That's one direction: things the other culture does that yours does not.</p>
<p>
More intense is what's present in your culture, but completely absent in the other. That gives rise to what Sigmund Freud called the "loss of a love-object"³.
</p>
<p>
For Freud, the lost love could be a person, but it could even be a deeply held concept.³
In an essay he wrote on the topic, Freud specifically mentions the loss of country as an example of such a loss³ (and thereby, one could say, culture).
</p>
<p>Maybe nobody cares about your academic credentials because the new society in which you find yourself is a "tough guy" society. Or maybe it's a "Six-Pack-Joe-The-Plumber-Schmoe" society, in which the hands-on work of skilled tradespeople holds a primacy so presuppositionally sacrosanct so as to seem, quite simply, obvious.</p>
<p>Baking the perfect baguette. Being a good Little League coach. Securing particular burial rites. The axioms of your childhood - those stars in the sky - while oftentimes powerful and reasonable, were cultural motifs all along. Relative truths, not absolute truths like chemistry or physics.</p>
<p>The effect is a double dose. That's because anyone of reasonable intellect must conclude it's not just the cultural motifs of society A that are not, in fact, fundamental laws of the universe, but rather that neither those of A nor those of B are.</p>
<p>And so, what remains?</p>
<p>French sculptor Bruno Catalano was born in Morocco in 1960. With his family, he immigrated to France at the age of 10.</p>
<p>He later created a series of statues titled "Les Voyageurs", which is French for "The Travelers".</p>
<p>Each statue is missing a piece of their body, symbolizing the lost love of moving to a different culture.</p>
