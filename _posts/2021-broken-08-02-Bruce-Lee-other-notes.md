    We often settle for indirect self-expression.
    For example, we try to express ourselves through success in our careers or through our influence on our children.
    The problem is those thing don't give you full artistic expressivity, exacting artistic control, a guarantee that the art will be experienced by others, nor a short feedback cycle with your audience.
    Painting a painting then sharing it gives you all four.

"The book is dedicated to: The Free, Creative Martial Artist."

    He had a positive authenticity about him.
    In the interview with Pierre Berton referenced above, you can sort of feel Berton appreciating Lee's authenticity, and showing Lee authenticity and respect in return.
    --TODO: watch the full interview, and add a link to the full interview, which is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk1lzkH-e4U

    Lee is a fine example of the confluence of philosophical ideation and concrete implementation.
    In ideation, he took formal coursework in philosophy at the University of Washington, and studied various intellectual topics in a wide-ranging manner on his own.
    In implementation, he put those ideas into practice as art: films, poetry, books, and martial arts.

    A commonality between philosophy and combat is essentialism.
    A street fight gets to some core aspects of human, and even animal, nature.
    A punch in the face is timeless, and, shall we say, unambiguous.

Likewise, if you continually click the first link on Wikipedia, you almost always eventually end up on the page for philosophy, no matter where you start.
And if you continue the process outward from the article for philosophy, you eventually end up ```````````````````````````````back at the article for philosophy.

Philosophy is a Greek word meaning "love of knowledge" or "love of wisdom". -https://www.etymonline.com/word/philosophy
It's the only field of study whose name itself speaks to love. -- TODO validate that that's true
An end onto itself, done out of love.

Bruce Lee understood the essential importance of family.
by all accounts he had great relationships with both his wife son and both of them remember him fondly and speak well of him.

Wiki for Jeet Kune Do: Jeet Kune Do, which Lee intended to have practical applications in life without the traditional routines and metaphysics of conventional martial arts, also incorporates a set of principles to help practitioners make quick decisions and improve their mental and physical health.

In other words you study or practice all the other subjects because they have some instrumental value, such as chemistry has an instrumental value,
And well you may find or discover a love of chemistry it's perhaps actually philosophy that you're discovering with in chemistry and what you really love is the knowledge or the wisdom that you see in a way through a lens of love in chemistry.
But philosophy is entirely about the love of knowledge or wisdom.

    This gets to a core idea of why we tend to admire people: those who have power but don't abuse it.
    Any schmoe can be peaceful. It's different when someone turns from violence to peace, especially when they're still quite capable of violence.
