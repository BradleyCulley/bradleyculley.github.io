<b>"The most important thing in the world is culture"</b>

<p>
I often come back to a conversation I heard years ago, between Dr. Joscha Bach, a German artificial intelligence researcher and cognitive scientist, and the AI model GPT-3.
Dr. Bach has prompted GPT-3 to answer as though GPT-3 were Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the famous 18th and 19th century German writer.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bach:</b><br/>
"The world is full of good things, and we can't experience them all.
We have to choose a few, and the problem is that we chose the wrong ones.
But then again, it's not our fault: we had no other choice."<br/><br/>
<b>Goethe:</b><br/>
"What can we do about it? We can only change the culture."<br/><br/>
<b>Bach:</b><br/>
"Johann, I agree. <b>The most important thing in the world is culture, because only with a good culture can we enjoy all of the good things that are available to us"</b>.<br/><br/>
<b>Goethe:</b><br/>
"Then let's begin to create a new culture."

I used to think technological innovation is the key to a better society.
If we made a better microchip or a new vaccine, things would be good.
That was part of my motivation to study and work in science and technology.
I still think it's part of the puzzle, but it's not the root solution.
</p>

Before discussing culture, it's worth looking at technology, because technology is nothing to sneeze at.
Only one event in human history has changed the course of human prosperity: the invention of the steam engine, in [[add date for its invention, and a citation]]

But then I became an adult and saw that despite incredible innovation in medicine, people suffer and die from uncomplicated diseases, including here in the United States (cite the gangrene in the one prison article from Mother Jones).
Among other sources, reading books by and about Paul Farmer was formative in this regard.
I've experienced it myself: healthcare inequality.

So what's this wealth, and this technology, worth if you have an underclass teeming with problems whose solutions are already known, and already implemented among the middle class and the wealthy?
Technology, entrepreneurship, wealth, and so on are great, actually.
They shouldn't themselves be attacked, as 
Communism is not the answer here, either.

A friend of mine from China once told me about the levels of underground housing in some Chinese cities.
You literally live in a cage, into which you lock yourself at night, to avoid being robbed or assaulted. 
There are no fire alarms or fire suppression systems. When fires break out, people are burned alive.
<include a link to a source on the underground networks for living.

One can't legislate away poverty.
Cue images of Hugo Chavez pointing at things and saying <insert what he said: "nationalize it"?>.

Legislation is a tool can be used to help solve the problem, but the problem isn't legislative.
Nor is raw wealth the solution.
It's perfectly possible to be wealthy and uncivilized, both at a societal level and at a personal level.
We've all met rich people who are totally nuts.
Similarly, societies and governments can be highly wealthy, yet highly inequitable, unfair, brutal, and/or corrupt.
Do any come to mind, perhaps?

The solution is culture.
The reason Nordic prisons are humane is not that there's this law or that law stating they ought to be, nor even because they're well-funded.
They're humane because the society is humane.
<Insert quote from Confucius about the layers of society, and them being in good order. Note that I quote him unironically, and greatly admire his thinking, and that it's a pet peeve that he's often quoted ironically in the West>.

But then I tell them, "If you think a bill of rights is what sets us apart,
you’re crazy." Every banana republic in the world has a bill of rights. Every
president for life has a bill of rights. The bill of rights of the former evil
empire, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, was much better than ours.
I mean it literally. It was much better. We guarantee freedom of speech and
of the press. Big deal. They guaranteed freedom of speech, of the press, of
street demonstrations and protests, and anyone who is caught trying to suppress criticism of the government will be called to account. 
Whoa, that is  wonderful stuff!
" - Antonin Scalia

That's a conservative political perspective.

“A people can never choose between different types of government. 
It can choose the outer trappings of government, but not the essential thing, the spirit of government—even though public opinion constantly confuses the two.
What gets written into a constitution is never essential.
The important thing is how the instinct of the people interprets it.”
― Oswald Spengler, Prussianism and Socialism

From a liberal political perspective, there's:

continuing on culture:
I've noticed people often couch solving these societal-level problems in the framework of left/right politics.
Or worse yet, American left/right politics. Clearly, if one or the other was the solution, you'd just implement that and be done with the whole thing.
Problems solved. But is Louisiana a utopia?
Is Venezuela a utopia?

Maybe left/right political alignment is _not the operative variable_!
I'm often reminded of the president of Denmark saying that Denmark is not a socialist country.
It's confusing to people who are so reductive in their thinking that they must couch everything in these left/right political terms. 
"Ok so Denmark is left-wing and that's the solution, right?" No, it's _the culture_.
"I know that some people in the US associate the Nordic model with some sort of socialism. 
Therefore I would like to make one thing clear. Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. 
Denmark is a market economy." - Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Prime Minister of Denmark (https://www.thelocal.dk/20151101/danish-pm-in-us-denmark-is-not-socialist)

When I studied abroad in Senegal, one of the Senegalese lecturers spoke about religion during one of his lectures. 
He explained religion in Senegal as something like this: <draw a diagram with Islam, etc. above, and a box all the way across the bottom for "animism">. You could draw a similar diagram for American politics, with left/right above, and individualism below (<link to Overindividualism post>): <include the drawing>. That's culture.

Also explain what culture is. 
It's not so much what we typically think of: food, language, religion, special dances, special clothes, cool hats.
It's what a mathematician would call axiomatic invariants.

When people speak of culture, they're often talking about _their_ culture, with the implicit assumption that it's "the best".
.

Or, more annoyingly perhaps, if you didn't adhere to their culture (because they don't want you muddying it up), but rather just went ahead and recognized that it's the best of all possible cultures and really ought to be revered as such.

This is particularly commonly applied in terms of the parts of a given culture that mentioned above: food, language, religion, etc.
People _really_ want you to just go ahead and amit their food is better, and if we're being honest, is "the best".

But I say forget the special foods, the rituals, the music; show me your prisons.

"The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons" -https://bigthink.com/words-of-wisdom/fyodor-dostoevsky-you-can-just-a-society-by-entering-its-prisons/

It's not a simple linear correlation with wealth, either. The United States is the richest country in the world, yet has horrifying prisons, and mass incarceration.
I've spoken with many Finns over the years; not one has bragged about their prisons, but they rightfully could.

So back to what culture is: culture is bedrock truths.
Often so presuppositional as to be more or less literally unspoken.
"Of course prisoners get abused! If you don't want to get abused, don't go to prison!". Sound familiar?

Some examples which are common, but importantly, have not been uniformly true across time and place:
-We don't murder people
-All people have equal human rights
-<add some more>

A culture need not be in one-to-one association with a nation.
Each family has its own culture.
The same for a given town, state or province, school or university, workplace, even a particular relationship between two people, and so on.

I tend to think of countries and cultures in terms of their prisons.
That's not because I've been to prison - I've never even been inside a prison or a jail - but because prisons reveal a culture for what it truly is.
They do so in the same way that watching your date interact with the waiter does: they show what behavior is like towards those in positions of relative powerlessness.
If he's a jerk to the waiter but nice to you, odds are he'll be a jerk to you if you lose your job and get cancer...because you'll no longer have anything he wants.

That's the key really: you cannot be civilized, or expect a fully good life or a civilized experience, in a society that is uncivilized. Saint Francis of Assisi

add to "the most important thing in the world" post: I once read a description of US Healthcare as being like a Rolls Royce. Packed with features, absolutely top-of-the-line, the best money can buy. And almost no one can afford it.

add to "the most important thing in the world" post: 

I've noticed that people who've found happiness in life have typically "found their tribe" and become part of the "Inner Ring" within that tribe, to use CS Lewis' excellent term (link his essay).
Military veteran, tenured professor, respected senior employee, loved grandmother with a big extended family. 
The tribe trusts you completely, and you trust the tribe completely.
I think that's deep genetics in play - success for most of human history, and even of organismal history within our lineage, was becoming a truly valued, trusted, well-respected, member of the tribe.


But enough about the shape of the problem: what's the solution?
Back to Bach's words: "What can we do about it? We can only change the culture."
How do we change the culture? How do we shape culture?
In my opinion, this question was solved by 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume.
Hume felt that the key to creating good culture is the "public intellectual".
That's oddly specific, but I think its true.
In particular, Hume made the distinction between the academic philosopher, cloistered in an ivory tower, and the public intellectual, who out of both inclination and necessity makes their work palatable and interesting for everyday people.
Some examples of public intellectuals: Buddha, Jesus, Noam Chomsky, Ayn Rand, Andreĭ Sakharov, Hannah Arendt, Albert Einstein, and Joan of Arc. 
David Hume was such a public intellectual: https://youtu.be/HS52H_CqZLE?si=vWyk8XRVA1agcwZJ

<add the point about Filipino culture: cite the article about percentage of people who feel loved.
Note how I felt this gravitational pull, so to speak, with talking with most Filipinos, that there were trying to find some way to, in a platonic sense at least, love me.
And I must say, it's quite nice. I enjoy talking with Filipinos.>
