Have been thinking about this idea recently, and was talking with someone about it a week or so ago:

Decision-making over a lifetime is traversing large n-ary tree of decisions.
Many of the nodes have decision paths that lead to really bad outcomes: death, incapacitation, imprisonment, etc.

There's also a stochastic element to it: people are victims of random crimes, random weather events, random diseases.

Some etiologies of disease are truly random. Moreover, preventative medicine is probabilistic. 
There is non-smoker's lung cancer, for example.
Intrusive thoughts, self-sabotage, the list goes on.

It's interesting to think, from a computational perspective, about those cultures that truly venerate the elderly.

Particularly the "in good social standing" elderly.
An 80-year-old in good social standing has truly navigated an impressive game of "life tetris".
All sufficiently old (i.e. mature) cultures that I'm aware of venerate the elderly.

It really is wise to venerate them, and learn their navigational subtleties.

12 years ago, I was doing a work-share on a farm in New Hampshire.
Somewhat impromptu, one of the people I was working for - a 68-year-old woman - told me "relationships are the most important thing in life".

Have been thinking about a lot of things in terms of the ruliad recently, and this is no exception.
That 80-year-old has made it deep into the ruliad.
