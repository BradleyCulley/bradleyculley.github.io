Decision-making over a lifetime is traversing large n-ary tree of decisions.

An n-ary tree looks like this:


The "n" in "n-ary" refers to the number of branches coming out of each node in the tree.

A 5-ary tree looks like this:


A lifetime of decisions would be a tree something like this:

The sheer number of decisions is immense.

One tends to discretize out a distillation of only the most salient ones, such as whether to take that new job.
There are so many more, though, that some percentage of the time have immense consequences.
Whether to talk to that stranger who seems a bit overly friendly.
Whether to slow down and tie your shoes before walking down the stairs.

Every year, 12,000 people die in stairway-related accidents.
Stairway accidents are the second leading cause of injury after motor vehicle accidents.
The seemingly-trivial can be consequential.

As with the stairway accidents, many of the nodes have decision paths that lead to really bad outcomes: death, incapacitation, imprisonment, etc.

There's also a stochastic element. People are victims of random crimes, random weather events, random diseases.
There is non-smoker's lung cancer, for example.

What a maze it is to navigate!
Intrusive thoughts, self-sabotage, the list goes on.

Perhaps this is why veneration of the elderly is such as common cultural belief worldwide.
Putting aside any other reason, they've TODO fill in
It's interesting to think, from a computational perspective, about those cultures that truly venerate the elderly.

Particularly the "in good social standing" elderly.
An 80-year-old in good social standing has truly navigated an impressive game of "life tetris".
All sufficiently old (i.e. mature) cultures that I'm aware of venerate the elderly.

It really is wise to venerate them, and learn their navigational subtleties.

12 years ago, I was doing a work-share on a farm in New Hampshire.
Somewhat impromptu, one of the people I was working for - a 68-year-old woman - told me "relationships are the most important thing in life".

Have been thinking about a lot of things in terms of the ruliad recently, and this is no exception.
That 80-year-old has made it deep into the ruliad.
