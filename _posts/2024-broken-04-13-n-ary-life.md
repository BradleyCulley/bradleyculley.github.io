### N-Ary Life

<p>
    <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">
        Decision-making over a lifetime is traversing a giant tree of options.
        Those who succeed are a bit like skilled craftpeople at the game of life.
    </div>
</p>

<p>
The "n" in "n-ary tree" refers to the maximum number of branches coming out of each node in the tree.
</p>

<p>
A 2-ary tree looks like this:
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img style="height: 80vh;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/binary-tree.png" />
</div>
</p>

<p>
A 3-ary tree:
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img style="height: 80vh;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/ternary-tree.png" />
</div>
</p>

<p>
And an n-ary tree:
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img style="height: 80vh;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/n-Ary-tree.png" />
</div>
</p>

<p>
And a lifetime of decisions:
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
</p>

<p>
The sheer number of decisions one makes, between birth and death, is enormous.
</p>

<p>
In our memories, we distill the most salient, such as choosing a spouse.
But there are so many more that matter greatly.
Whether to talk to that stranger who seems a bit too friendly.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Whether to slow down and tie your shoes before walking down the stairs.
Every year, 12,000 people die in stairway-related accidents. -https://www.attorneywdkickham.com/stairway-staircase-accidents.html#:~:text=Consider%20these%20statistics%20from%20the,are%2012%2C000%20stairway%20accident%20deaths.
Stairway accidents are the second leading cause of injury after motor vehicle accidents. -https://www.attorneywdkickham.com/stairway-staircase-accidents.html#:~:text=Consider%20these%20statistics%20from%20the,are%2012%2C000%20stairway%20accident%20deaths.
Seemingly-trivial, yet in truth, consequential.
</p>

<p>
As with the stairway accidents, surprisingly-many decision paths lead to really bad outcomes: death, incapacitation, imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
There's also stochasticity: random crimes, random weather events, random diseases.
Non-smoker's lung cancer, for example.
What a maze!
</p>

<p>
Intrusive thoughts, self-sabotage, fake friends...the list goes on.
</p>

<p>
All cultures I'm aware of venerate the elderly as a general principle.
</p>

<p>
Putting aside other motivations for this veneration, an elderly person has exhibited a certain impressive technical skill.
The ancient Greeks had a special word - technê - for practical knowledge.
They had a separate word - epistêmê - for purely theoretical knowledge.
</p>

<p>
String theory would be epistêmê; how to behave in a job interview would be technê.
Socrates, the great Greek philosopher, believed that technê - practical knowledge - is the most important kind of knowledge.
The pinnacle of knowledge, one could say.  -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techne, or https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/episteme-techne/
</p>

<p>
This is something I've noticed among older people in good social standing.
Like the cage fighter who knows how to handle themselves in the cage, they may not know all manner of theory in martial arts, but they're good on the important stuff, and on what actually works. 
</p>

<p>
An 80-year-old in good social standing has navigated an impressively large game of "life tetris".
It really is wise to venerate them, and to learn their navigational subtleties.
</p>

<p>
In 2012, I was doing a work-share on a farm in New Hampshire.
One day, one of the farmers and I were weeding a flower garden, chatting as we worked side-by-side.
She was 68 years old, and by all measures had "won the game of life".
</p>

<p>
She was happily married and had been for over 40 years, had three successful children (all with Ivy League university degrees), a big house, good health, and many good friends.
A bit out of the flow of the conversation, she paused for a minute and said to me in what seemed to be a very carefully considered way, "relationships are the most important thing in life".
