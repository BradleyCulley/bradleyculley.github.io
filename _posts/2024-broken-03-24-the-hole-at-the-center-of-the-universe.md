There is a kind of sadness that comes from knowing too much, from seeing the world as it truly is. It is the sadness of understanding that life is not a grand adventure, but a series of small, insignificant moments, that love is not a fairy tale, but a fragile, fleeting emotion, that happiness is not a permanent state, but a rare, fleeting glimpse of something we can never hold onto. And in that understanding, there is a profound loneliness, a sense of being cut off from the world, from other people, from oneself.
â€” Virginia Woolf, To the Lighthouse

Talk about theodicy

Include this video from Elliot - Rachel Grimes: bloodroot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3RR1Wg_DCE

Maybe talk about Heidegerrian Factity, Gerworfenheit, and Dasein 

Talk about Kurt Vonnegut and his writings. In particular, first, his experience in Dresden and his sentence about the bone dust mixed into the ground there.
And second, his mention of the marathon runner, dead from old age on a stretcher in a hospital.
