I read this when I was around 8 years old, in around 1998. It is a literary masterpiece.

"Should appeal to all rugged individualists who dream of escape to the forest."

A summary of the book:

<blockquote>
My Side of the Mountain is a middle-grade adventure novel written and illustrated by American writer Jean Craighead George published by E. P. Dutton in 1959. It features a boy who learns courage, independence, and the need for companionship while attempting to live in the Catskill Mountains of New York State. In 1960, it was one of three Newbery Medal Honor Books (runners-up) and in 1969 it was loosely adapted as a film of the same name. George continued the story in print, decades later.

Biographical information about the author:
<blockquote>
<p>
Jean Carolyn Craighead was born on July 2, 1919, in Washington DC. She was raised in a family of naturalists. Her mother, father (Frank Craighead Sr.), brothers (Frank and John), aunts, and uncles were students of nature. On weekends they camped in the woods near Washington, climbed trees to study owls, gathered edible plants, and made fish hooks from twigs. Her first pet was a turkey vulture. George centered her life around writing and nature.
</p>

<p>
George graduated in 1940 from Pennsylvania State University with degrees in both English and science. In the 1940s she was a member of the White House Press Corps and a reporter for The Washington Post. From 1969 to 1982 she was a writer and editor at Reader's Digest. She married John Lothar George in 1944, and they divorced in 1963. Her first novels were written in collaboration with him, and she provided the illustrations for them, done in black and white watercolors or inks. A later editor encouraged her to use other illustrators for her books.

<p>
Mrs. George is both superbly accomplished and truly prolific. She wrote over 100 books. A staggering body of work.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
My Side of the Mountain is wholly saturated with a sense of wonder and magic. Perhaps more riveting (to me anyway), more saturated with wonder, more compelling, and more magical, than even the likes of Harry Potter.
</p>

<p>
Unlike Harry Potter, it’s set in the real world, with a plot that’s realistically completely possible, though unlikely. This is something the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Tracy Kidder often talks about. For example:
<blockquote>
A lot of the job of a person trying to write stories that are true is to make
what’s true believable. It isn’t enough to say, well, it actually happened. You
have to make it believable on the page; you have to bring people to life and
scenes to life.

</p>

<p>
Tracy Kidder writes nonfiction books - biographies and such - but it's a similar principle. Embedding the life of a famous person in the grittiness of the real world all the more enhances their greatness and makes for a great read.

In particular, it makes real how it was perhaps possible that you or I could have been that person. Flesh and blood.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
My Side of the Mountain feels like this as well.
It's easy to slip into identifying with Sam, the protagonist. 
His practical struggles against nature yet thoughtful alignment with nature, his cunning use of tools, and his exaltation to be so enmeshed in nature.
</p>

<p>
He hollows out a tree and makes that his home in the forest.
He tames a peregrine falcon, whom he names "Frightful".
He learns how to hunt, trap, fish, prepare meat, forage for wild foods, build a clay fireplace, tan hides, and fashion for himself a full set of clothes out of deer hide.
</p>

<p>
One detail of salience, that I found somehow resonant, is in a scene in which Sam is looking at a deceased deer.
Sam feels an intrinsic "pull" toward eating the liver of the deer.
This is explained as a primal hunger borne from a particular nutritional deficit.
</p>

<p>
The deficit may have been iron and vitamin B12, the lack of which increases the risk of anemia.
That primeval "pull" is something I’ve experienced at times as well; for example, a pull toward dark red foods such as raspberries when I was stressed.
Dark red foods have a number of compounds that counteract oxidative stress, including anthocyanins, betalains, carotenoids, polyphenols, and tannins. --TODO add citation

<hr/>

<p>
Sam meets people along the way during his adventures.
Characteristically though, none join his space permanently.
For example, he meets a lost English professor, they become friends, and Sam visits the professor at Christmas.
However, neither moves to live near the other permanently.
</p>

<p>
It is only as an adult, reflecting back on the contents of this book, that it occurs to me how quintessentially culturally American it is.
Culture is the air one breathes, so to speak, so I didn't even notice the US-aligned cultural motifs.
One such subsurface motif, is what can be called a "ruralist mentality".
</p>

<p>
I’d say most Americans, regardless of their more subcultural niche, would respond positively to a story about a person striking out into the wilderness, making a home and a life for themselves.
Also, especially doing so alone.
Richard Proenneke and Chris McCandless (the subject of the book "Into the Wild") come to mind.
Ruralism is highly culturally American, as is individualism.
</p>

<p>
A family friend of ours was married into a family from Finland.
One time, it came up in conversation that one of the young men on the American side had gone out into the forest and built a small cabin/treehouse for himself.
One of the Finnish folks commented that it would be rare for someone to do that in Finland.
I think they meant, in particular, to do so alone (individualism).
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
According to Professor Geert Hofstede, the United States is the most culturally individualistic country in the world: https://clearlycultural.com/geert-hofstede.../individualism/.
The loneliness of ruralist individualism creates a key narrative tension in the book.
The love of solitude and love of nature on one side; the love of people and companionship on the other
</p>

<p>
Mrs. George handles that tension with a masterful touch.
In part, it’s handled through Sam's bond with the Peregrine Falcon he tames, whom he names Frightful.
There's an independent truth illuminated there too: that non-human animals can often be better friends than can humans.
</p>

<p>
Many a dog or cat lover has left their inheritance to their pet.
At a certain point a love for their non-human friend being more fierce than anything to be mustered toward the often duplicitous humans in their lives.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
Mrs. George also beautifully conveys her love of nature.
She employs descriptive detail of a profundity that can only well up from an equal depth of personal rapture.
As I remember her descriptions: leaves, weather and seasons, the textures of various parts of particular kinds of trees (bark, trunk, etc.).
The protean majesty of starting a fire with tinder and flint.
</p>

<p>
Trapping, hunting, fishing with a wooden hook.
The Thoreauvian pleasure of meeting a stranger in the woods.
The sparkling wonder of a pristine forest stream, serendipitously discovered.
As I recall, Sam discovers a stream, fed by a natural spring, near the tree that becomes his home.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
The book is a mesmerizing work of art and I cannot recommend it highly enough.
</p>

<p>
As I recall, as a kid I also read the sequel to "My Side of the Mountain": "On the Far Side of the Mountain".
For both books, the saying about people one meets in life comes to mind: I can’t remember every detail of what was said, but I'll always remember how they made me feel.
