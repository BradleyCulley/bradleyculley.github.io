I read this when I was around 8 years old, in around 1998. It is a literary masterpiece.

A summary of the book:

<blockquote>
My Side of the Mountain is a middle-grade adventure novel written and illustrated by American writer Jean Craighead George published by E. P. Dutton in 1959. It features a boy who learns courage, independence, and the need for companionship while attempting to live in the Catskill Mountains of New York State. In 1960, it was one of three Newbery Medal Honor Books (runners-up) and in 1969 it was loosely adapted as a film of the same name.

<p>
My Side of the Mountain is wholly saturated with a sense of wonder and magic. Perhaps more riveting (to me anyway), more saturated with wonder, more compelling, and more magical, than even the likes of Harry Potter.
</p>

<p>
Unlike Harry Potter, it’s set in the real world, with a plot that’s realistically completely possible, though unlikely.
This is something the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Tracy Kidder often talks about.<br/><br/>

For example:
<blockquote>
A lot of the job of a person trying to write stories that are true is to make
what’s true believable. It isn’t enough to say, well, it actually happened. You
have to make it believable on the page; you have to bring people to life and
scenes to life. 

-Tracy Kidder

</p>

<p>
Tracy Kidder writes nonfiction books - biographies and such - but it's a similar principle. Embedding the life of a famous person in the grittiness of the real world somehow enhances their greatness and makes for a captivating read.

It makes real how it was perhaps possible that you or I could have been that person. Flesh and blood.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
My Side of the Mountain feels just like this.
It's easy to slip into identifying with Sam Gribley, the protagonist. 
His practical struggles against nature, yet thoughtful alignment with nature, his cunning use of tools, and his exaltation to be so enmeshed in nature.
Enmeshed in a very comforting way — engulfed, embraced.
</p>

<p>
He hollows out a tree and makes that his home in the forest.
He tames a peregrine falcon, whom he names "Frightful".
He learns how to hunt, trap, fish, prepare meat, forage for wild foods, build a clay fireplace, tan hides, and create a full set of clothes out of deer hide.
</p>

<p>
One detail of salience, that I found particularly resonant, is in a scene in which Sam is looking at a deceased deer.
Sam feels an intrinsic "pull" toward eating the liver of the deer.
This is explained as a primal hunger borne from a particular nutritional deficit. -TODO: check this citation
</p>

<p>
The deficit may have been iron and vitamin B12, the lack of which increases the risk of anemia.
That primeval "pull" is something I’ve experienced at times as well; for example, a pull toward dark red foods such as raspberries when I was stressed.
Dark red foods have a number of compounds that counteract oxidative stress, including anthocyanins, betalains, carotenoids, polyphenols, and tannins. --TODO add citation
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
Sam meets people during his adventures.
Characteristically though, none join his space permanently.
For example, he meets a lost English professor, they become friends, and Sam visits the professor at Christmas.
However, neither moves to live near the other permanently.
</p>

<p>
It is only as an adult, reflecting back on the contents of this book, that it occurs to me how quintessentially culturally American the book is.
Culture is the air one breathes, so to speak, so I didn't even notice the US-aligned cultural motifs.
One such "subsurface" motif, is what could be called a "ruralist mentality".
</p>

<p>
I’d say most Americans, regardless of their more subcultural niche, would respond positively to a story about a person striking out into the wilderness, building a home with their own hands, and creating a mostly self-sufficient life for themselves (gardening, etc.) whilst deeply enmeshed in nature.
Also, especially doing so alone.
Richard Proenneke - a famous homesteader in the Alaskan wilderness, and Chris McCandless (the subject of the book "Into the Wild") come to mind.
Ruralism is highly culturally American, as is individualism.
</p>

<p>
A family friend of ours married into a family from Finland.
My father told me that one time it came up in conversation that one of the young men on the American side had gone out into the forest and built a small cabin/treehouse for himself.
One of the Finnish folks commented that it would be rare for someone to do that in Finland.
Apparently they meant, in particular, to do so alone (individualism).
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
According to Professor Geert Hofstede, the United States is the most culturally individualistic country in the world: https://clearlycultural.com/geert-hofstede.../individualism/.
The loneliness of ruralist individualism creates a key narrative tension in the book.
The love of nature and solitude on one side; the love of companionship on the other.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. George handles that tension with masterful touch.
In part, it's handled through Sam's bond with the Peregrine Falcon he tames, whom he names Frightful.
There's an independent truth illuminated there too: that non-human animals can often be better friends than can humans.
</p>

<p>
Many a dog or cat lover has left their inheritance to their pet.
At a certain point the love for their non-human friend becomes more fierce than anything to be mustered toward the often duplicitous humans in their lives.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
Mrs. George also beautifully conveys her love of nature.
She employs descriptive detail of a profundity that can only well up from an equal depth of personal rapture.
As I remember her descriptions: leaves, weather and seasons, and the textures of various parts of particular kinds of trees (bark, trunk, etc.).
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I lived close to the weather. It is surprising how you watch it when
you live in it. Not a cloud passed unnoticed, not a wind blew untested. I
knew the moods of the storms, where they came from, their shapes and
colors. When the sun shone, I took Frightful to the meadow and we slid
down the mountain on my snapping-turtle-shell sled. She really didn’t care
much for this.
</p>

<p>
When the winds changed and the air smelled like snow, I would stay
in my tree, because I had gotten lost in a blizzard one afternoon and had had
to hole up in a rock ledge until I could see where I was going. That day the
winds were so strong I could not push against them, so I crawled under the
ledge; for hours I wondered if I would be able to dig out when the storm
blew on. Fortunately I only had to push through about a foot of snow.
However, that taught me to stay home when the air said ‘snow.’ Not that I
was afraid of being caught far from home in a storm, for I could find food
and shelter and make a fire anywhere, but I had become as attached to my
hemlock house as a brooding bird to her nest. Caught out in the storms and
weather, I had an urgent desire to return to my tree, even as The Baron
Weasel returned to his den, and the deer to their copse. We all had our little
'patch' in the wilderness. We all fought to return there.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Her description of the protean majesty of starting a fire with tinder and flint:
<blockquote>
I must say this now about that first fire. It was magic. Out of dead
tinder and grass and sticks came a live warm light. It cracked and snapped
and smoked and filled the woods with brightness. It lighted the trees and
made them warm and friendly. It stood tall and bright and held back the
night. Oh, this was a different night than the first dark frightful one. Also I
was stuffed on catfish. I have since learned to cook it more, but never have I
enjoyed a meal as much as that one, and never have I felt so independent
again.

<p>
Trapping, hunting, fishing with a wooden hook.
The Thoreauvian pleasure of meeting a stranger in the woods.
The sparkling wonder of a pristine forest stream, serendipitously discovered.
As I recall, Sam discovers a stream, fed by a natural spring, near the tree that becomes his home.
</p>

or this:
Five notches into June, my house was done. I could stand in it, lie down in
it, and there was room left over for a stump to sit on. On warm evenings I
would lie on my stomach and look out the door, listen to the frogs and
nighthawks, and hope it would storm so that I could crawl into my tree and
be dry. I had gotten soaked during a couple of May downpours, and now
that my house was done, I wanted the chance to sit in my hemlock and
watch a cloudburst wet everything but me. This opportunity didn’t come for
a long time. It was dry.

or this:
‘Today I rafted out into the deep pools of the creek to fish. It was a
lazy sort of autumn day, the sky clear, the leaves beginning to brighten, the
air warm. I stretched out on my back because the fish weren’t biting, and
hummed.

or this:
With Christmas over, the winter became serious. The snows deepened, the
wind blew, the temperatures dropped until the air snapped and talked. Never
had humanity seemed so far away as it did in those cold still months of
January, February, and March. I wandered the snowy crags, listening to the
language of the birds by day and to the noises of the weather by night. The
wind howled, the snow avalanched, and the air creaked.

I slept, ate, played my reed whistle, and talked to Frightful.
To be relaxed, warm, and part of the winter wilderness is an
unforgettable experience. I was in excellent condition. Not a cold, not a
sniffle, not a moment of fatigue. I enjoyed the feeling that I could eat, sleep
and be warm, and outwit the storms that blasted the mountains and the
subzero temperatures that numbed them.

<p>
The book is a mesmerizing work of art and I cannot recommend it highly enough.
</p>

<p>
When I was in elementary school, I packed my suitcase and told my mother
I was going to run away from home. As I envisioned it, I would live by a
waterfall in the woods and catch fish on hooks made from the forks of tree
limbs, as I had been taught by my father. I would walk among the
wildflowers and trees, listen to the birds, read the weather report in the
clouds and the wind, and stride down mountainsides independent and free.
Wisely, my mother did not try to dissuade me. She had been through this
herself. She checked my bag to see if I had my toothbrush and a postcard to
let her know how I was getting along, and kissed me good-by. Forty
minutes later I was home.
When my daughter, Twig, was in elementary school, she told me she
was going to run away to the woods. I checked her backpack for her
toothbrush and watched her go down the front steps, her shoulders squared
confidently. I blew her a kiss and sat down to wait. Presently, she was back.
Although wishing to run to the woods and live on our own seems to
be an inherited characteristic in our family, we are not unique. Almost
everyone I know has dreamed at some time of running away to a distant
mountain or island, castle or sailing ship, to live there in beauty and peace.
Few of us make it, however.

It is one thing to wish to go, and another matter to do it. I might have
been able to do what Sam Gribley does in this book—live off the land,
make a home, survive by wits and library research, for I had the knowledge.
My father, who was a naturalist and scientist, taught me the plants and
animals of eastern forests and showed me where the wild edible fruits and
tubers grew. On weekends along the Potomac River near Washington, D.C.,
where I was born and grew up, he and I boiled water in leaves and made
rabbit traps. Together we made tables and chairs out of saplings bound with
the braided inner bark of the basswood tree. My brothers, two of the first
falconers in the United States, helped me in the training of a falcon. I had
the know-how for surviving in the woods; and yet I came home.
‘But not Sam,’ I said to myself when I sat down at my typewriter and
began putting on paper this story, one that I had been writing in my head for
many, many years.

The writing came easily—Sam needed a home. I remembered a huge
tree my brothers had camped in on an island in the Potomac River. A tree
would be Sam’s home. And I knew how he would survive when foraging
became tough. ‘A falcon will be his provider,’ I said to myself.
With ideas coming fast, the first draft was done in two weeks. Five
revisions later, it was finished and off to the publisher. Back came a phone
call from Sharon Bannigan, the editor of E. P. Dutton’s children’s book
department at that time.
‘Elliott Macrae, the publisher,’ she said, ‘won’t print the book. He
says parents should not encourage their kids to leave home.’
Discouraged, I hung up the phone and walked out into the woods
behind the house. As always when I am in the wildwood, I very quickly
forgot what was troubling me. A sentinel crow was protecting its flock by
watching the sky for hawks; a squirrel was building a nest of leaves for the
winter; a spider was tapping out a message to his mate on a line of her web.
Better to run to the woods than the city, I thought. Here, there is the
world to occupy the mind.

The telephone rang. Sharon Bannigan was back on the wire, and she
was almost singing. Elliott Macrae had changed his mind. And what, I
asked her, had worked the miracle?
‘I simply told him it is better to have children run to the woods than
the city,’ she said. ‘He thought about that. Since he has a home in the wilds
of the Adirondack Mountains and goes off there alone himself, he suddenly
understood your book. My Side of the Mountain will be published in the
spring of ’59.’
From that date to this, I have been answering children’s letters about
Sam. Most want to know if he is a real person. Some, convinced that he is,
have biked to Delhi, New York, from as far away as Long Island, New
York, to find his tree, his falcon, weasel, and raccoon. To these and all
others who ask, I say, ‘There is no real Sam, except inside me.’ His
adventures are the fulfillment of that day long ago when I told my mother I
was going to run away, got as far as the edge of the woods, and came back.
Perhaps Sam will fulfill your dreams, too. Be you writer or reader, it is very
pleasant to run away in a book.

<p>
As a kid I believe I also read "On the Far Side of the Mountain", which is the sequel to "My Side of the Mountain".
For both books, the saying about people one meets in life comes to mind: I can't remember everything that was said, but I'll always remember how they made me feel.
