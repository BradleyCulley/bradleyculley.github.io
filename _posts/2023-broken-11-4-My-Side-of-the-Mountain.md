My Side of the Mountain, by Jean Craighead George

First published in 1959

—----------------

I read this when I was around eight or ten years old, in around 1998-2000. It is a literary masterpiece.

"Should appeal to all rugged individualists who dream of escape to the forest."
-The New York Times Book Review

Summary of the book, from Wikipedia:
“
My Side of the Mountain is a middle-grade adventure novel written and illustrated by American writer Jean Craighead George published by E. P. Dutton in 1959. It features a boy who learns courage, independence, and the need for companionship while attempting to live in the Catskill Mountains of New York State. In 1960, it was one of three Newbery Medal Honor Books (runners-up) and in 1969 it was loosely adapted as a film of the same name. George continued the story in print, decades later.

Summary about the author, from Wikipedia:
“
Jean Carolyn Craighead was born on July 2, 1919, in Washington DC. She was raised in a family of naturalists. Her mother, father (Frank Craighead Sr.), brothers (Frank and John), aunts, and uncles were students of nature. On weekends they camped in the woods near Washington, climbed trees to study owls, gathered edible plants, and made fish hooks from twigs. Her first pet was a turkey vulture. George centered her life around writing and nature.

George graduated in 1940 from Pennsylvania State University with degrees in both English and science. In the 1940s she was a member of the White House Press Corps and a reporter for The Washington Post. From 1969 to 1982 she was a writer and editor at Reader's Digest. She married John Lothar George in 1944, and they divorced in 1963. Her first novels were written in collaboration with him, and she provided the illustrations for them, done in black and white watercolors or inks. A later editor encouraged her to use other illustrators for her books.

Mrs. George is both superbly accomplished and truly prolific. She wrote over 100 books. A staggering body of work.

My Side of the Mountain is wholly saturated with a sense of wonder and magic. Perhaps more riveting (to me anyway), more saturated with wonder, more compelling, and more magical, than even the likes of Harry Potter.

Unlike Harry Potter, it’s set in the real world, with a plot that’s realistically completely possible, though unlikely. I once read a passage about the author Tracy Kidder that said something like that his core skill is “making reality real”.

Tracy Kidder writes nonfiction - biographies and such - but it’s a similar principle. Drawing the reality of a famous person’s life into realness and out of myth. Embedding it in the grittiness of the real world all the more enhances the greatness of the life in question.

In particular, how it was perhaps possible that you or I could have been that person. Flesh and blood.

My Side of the Mountain feels like this as well. It’s easy to slip into identifying with Sam, the protagonist. His practical struggles against nature, careful use of and alignment with nature, and exaltation to be so enmeshed in nature.

He hollows out a tree and makes that his home in the forst. He tames a peregrine falcon, whom he names “Frightful”. He learns how to hunt, trap, fish, prepare meat, forage for wild foods, build a clay fireplace, tan hides, and fashion clothes for himself from deer hides.

One detail of particular salience, that I particularly loved, is in a scene in which Sam is looking at the meat of a deer. Sam feels an intrinsic “pull” toward eating the liver of the deer. This is explained as a primal hunger borne from a particular nutritional deficit.

The deficit may have been iron and vitamin B12, the lack of which increases the risk of anemia. That primeval “pull” is something I’ve experienced at times as well.

He meets people along the way during his adventures. Characteristically though, none come into his space permanently. For example, he meets a lost English professor, they become friends, and Sam visits the professor at Christmas. But neither moves to live near the other permanently.

It is only as an adult, reflecting back on the contents of this book, that it occurs to me how quintessentially culturally American it is. Culture is the air one breathes: it’s the baseline set of values taken for granted in a given society. One such value, that’s not at the surface of everyday discussion, but is very much present, is what can be called a “ruralist mentality”.

I’d say most Americans, regardless of their more niche subculture, would respond positively to a story about a person striking out into the wilderness, making a home and a life for themselves. Ruralism is culturally fundamentally American.

A family friend of ours was married into a family from Finland. It once came up in conversation that one of the young men on the American side had gone out into the forest and built a small cabin/treehouse for himself. One of the Finns commented that it would be rare for someone to do that in Finland. I think they meant, in particular, to do so alone.

That’s another cultural value that permeates both the book and American culture: individualism. According to Professor Geert Hofstede, the United States is the most culturally individualistic country in the world: https://clearlycultural.com/geert-hofstede.../individualism/.

That’s a key narrative tension in the book. The love of solitude and love of nature on one side; the love of people and need of companionship on the other. Mrs. George handles that tension superbly. In part, it’s handled through Sam’s bond with the Peregrine Falcon he tames, whom he names Frightful.

There’s a truth illuminated there that non-human animals can often be better and more loyal friends than their human counterparts. Many a dog or cat lover has left their inheritance to their pet. A love for their non-human friend perhaps more fierce than anything to be mustered toward the often duplicitous humans in their lives.

Mrs. George also beautifully conveys her love of nature. She employs descriptive detail that is of a profundity that can only well up from an equal depth of personal experience in nature. As I remember it: leaves, weather and seasons, the textures of various parts of particular kinds of trees. The protean majesty of starting a fire with tinder and flint.

Trapping, hunting, fishing with a wooden hook. The Thoreauvian pleasure of meeting a stranger in the woods. The sparkling wonder of a pristine body of water. As I recall, Sam discovers a stream, fed by a natural spring, near the tree that is his home.

The book is a mesmerizing work of art. The best way to experience it is firsthand, in reading it for oneself.

As I recall, as a kid I also read the sequel: “On the Far Side of the Mountain”. For both books, the saying about people one meets in life applies: I can’t remember exactly what was said, but I remember how they made me feel.
