Me in a treehouse in the early 2000s, not long after I read My Side of the Mountain
</div>
<br>

<hr/>

<p>
First published in 1959².
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
I read My Side of the Mountain when I was around 8 years old, in around 1998. It's a literary masterpiece.

<p>
I once read a post online in which the poster said something like that "cozy is the best human feeling". --TODO: find citation
They're perhaps onto something.
My Side of The Mountain is coziness in book form.
It's coziness is the coziness of watching a rainstorm through a half-closed window, curled up with a blanket in a window seat.
At the junction of wild nature and one's protected space away from the elements.

<p>
A summary of the book:

<blockquote>
My Side of the Mountain is a middle-grade adventure novel written and illustrated by American writer Jean Craighead George published by E. P. Dutton in 1959. It features a boy who learns courage, independence, and the need for companionship while attempting to live in the Catskill Mountains of New York State. In 1960, it was one of three Newbery Medal Honor Books (runners-up) and in 1969 it was loosely adapted as a film of the same name.¹
</blockquote>

About the Newbery Medal:
<blockquote>
[The Newbery Medal]...is a literary award given by the Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC), a division of the American Library Association (ALA), to the author of "the most distinguished contributions to American literature for children". The Newbery and the Caldecott Medal are considered the two most prestigious awards for children's literature in the United States.³

More about the plot of the book:
<blockquote>
<p>Sam Gribley is a 12-year-old boy who intensely dislikes living in his parents' cramped New York City apartment with his eight brothers and sisters. He decides to run away to his great-grandfather's abandoned farm in the Catskill Mountains to live in the wilderness. The novel begins in the middle of Sam's story, with Sam huddled in his treehouse home in the forest during a severe blizzard. Frightful, Sam's pet peregrine falcon, and The Baron, a weasel, share the home with him. In a flashback, Sam reminisces about how he came to be there.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Sam forages for edible plants and traps animals for food. He uses fire to make the interior of a hollow tree bigger. Seeing a peregrine falcon hunting for prey, Sam decides he wants a falcon as a hunting bird. Sam goes to town and reads up on falconry at the local public library. He steals a chick from a falcon's nest and names the bird Frightful.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>
Frightful proves to be very good at hunting. Sam prepares for winter by hunting, preserving wild grains and tubers, smoking fish and meat, and preparing storage spaces in hollowed-out trunks of trees. Finding another poached deer, Sam makes himself deerskin clothing to replace his worn-out clothes. Sam notices a raccoon digging for mussels in the creek and learns how to hunt for shellfish.
</p>

<p>
In June, Sam is surprised to find his family has come to the Gribley land. His father announces that the family is moving there. Sam is happy at first, then also upset because it means the end of his self-sufficiency. As the novel ends, Sam concludes that life is about balancing his desire to live off the land with his desire to be with the people he loves.²

<hr/>

<p>
My Side of the Mountain is saturated with wonder and magic. Perhaps more riveting (to me anyway), more compelling, and more magical, than even the likes of The Lord of the Rings.
</p>

<p>
Unlike The Lord of the Rings, it's set in the real world, with a plot that's realistically possible (though unlikely).
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
Perhaps partly because of the book's plausible realism, it's easy to slip into identifying with Sam Gribley. 
His practical struggles against nature, his thoughtful alignment with nature, his cunning use of tools, his exaltation at being so enmeshed in nature.
</p>

<p>
In one scene, Sam is preparing to eat a rabbit caught by his falcon Frightful.
He feels an intrinsic "pull" toward eating the liver.
This is explained as a primal pull toward a source of vitamin C during the winter when sources of it are scarce.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
One morning my nose bled. It frightened me a bit, and I wondered if I shouldn’t hike to the library and reread the material on vitamins.
It didn't last long, however, so I figured it wasn't too serious.
I decided I would live until the greens came to the land, for I was of the opinion that since I had had nothing green for months, that was probably the trouble.
</p>

<p>On that same day Frightful caught a rabbit in the meadow.
As I cleaned it, the liver suddenly looked so tempting that I could hardly wait to prepare it.
For the next week, I craved liver and ate all I could get.
The tiredness ended, the bones stopped aching and I had no more nosebleeds.
Hunger is a funny thing. It has a kind of intelligence all its own. 
I ate liver almost every day until the first plants emerged, and I never had any more trouble. 
I have looked up vitamins since. 
I am not surprised to find that liver is rich in vitamin C. So are citrus fruits and green vegetables, the foods I lacked. 
Wild plants like sorrel and dock are rich in this vitamin.
Even if I had known this at that time, it would have done me no good, for they were but roots in the earth.
As it turned out, liver was the only available source of vitamin C—and on liver I stuffed, without knowing why.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That primeval "pull" is something I’ve experienced too.
For example, I remember once, when I was stressed, feeling a pull toward dark red foods such as raspberries.
It turns out dark red foods have a number of compounds that counteract stress. --TODO add citation

<hr/>

<p>
Sam meets people during his adventures.
Characteristically, none join his space permanently.
For example, he meets a lost English professor, they become friends, and Sam visits the professor at Christmas.
However, neither moves to live near the other permanently.
</p>

<p>
It is only as an adult, reflecting back on the contents of this book, that it occurs to me how culturally American it is.
Culture is the air one breathes, so as a child I didn't notice.
One such cultural motif, is what could be called a "ruralist mentality".
</p>

<p>
Most Americans, regardless of their more subcultural niche, would enjoy a story about a person striking out into the wilderness, building a home with their own hands, and creating a mostly self-sufficient life for themselves (gardening, etc.) whilst deeply and happily enmeshed in nature.
Also and especially, doing so alone, or with just one or two others, as the US is also quite culturally individualistic.
Richard Proenneke - a famous homesteader in the Alaskan wilderness, and Chris McCandless (the subject of the book "Into the Wild") come to mind.
Ruralism and individualism.
</p>

<p>
A family friend of ours once married into a family from Finland.
My father said it once came up in conversation that one of the young men on the American side had gone out into the forest and built a small treehouse for himself.
One of the Finnish folks commented that it would be rare for someone to do that in Finland.
Apparently they meant, in particular, to do so alone (individualism).
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
The loneliness of ruralistic individualism creates a key narrative tension in the book.
As mentioned in the plot summary above, with respect to Sam's family moving to him, there's Sam's love of nature and solitude on one side, and his love of people and companionship on the other.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. George handles that tension with beautiful sophistication and nuance.
In part, she handles it through Sam's bond with the Peregrine Falcon he tames, whom he names Frightful.
There's an independent truth there: non-human animals can sometimes be better friends than can humans.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
Mrs. George also beautifully conveys her love of nature.
She employs descriptive detail of a profundity that can only well up from an equal depth of personal rapture.
As I remember her descriptions: leaves, weather and seasons, the textures of various parts of trees (bark, trunk, etc.), and so much more.
</p>

<p>
To quote a narrative passage from Sam:
<blockquote>
<p>
I lived close to the weather. It is surprising how you watch it when you live in it.
Not a cloud passed unnoticed, not a wind blew untested.
I knew the moods of the storms, where they came from, their shapes and colors.
When the sun shone, I took Frightful to the meadow and we slid down the mountain on my snapping-turtle-shell sled.
She really didn't care much for this.
</p>

<p>
When the winds changed and the air smelled like snow, I would stay in my tree, because I had gotten lost in a blizzard one afternoon and had had to hole up in a rock ledge until I could see where I was going. 
That day the winds were so strong I could not push against them, so I crawled under the ledge; for hours I wondered if I would be able to dig out when the storm blew on.
Fortunately I only had to push through about a foot of snow.
However, that taught me to stay home when the air said 'snow.' 
Not that I was afraid of being caught far from home in a storm, for I could find food and shelter and make a fire anywhere, but I had become as attached to my hemlock house as a brooding bird to her nest.
Caught out in the storms and weather, I had an urgent desire to return to my tree, even as The Baron Weasel returned to his den, and the deer to their copse.
We all had our little 'patch' in the wilderness. We all fought to return there.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
A passage of Sam describing the protean majesty of starting a fire with tinder and flint:
<blockquote>
I must say this now about that first fire. It was magic. 
Out of dead tinder and grass and sticks came a live warm light.
It cracked and snapped and smoked and filled the woods with brightness.
It lighted the trees and made them warm and friendly.
It stood tall and bright and held back the night. Oh, this was a different night than the first dark frightful one. 
Also I was stuffed on catfish. I have since learned to cook it more, but never have I enjoyed a meal as much as that one, and never have I felt so independent again.

</p>

<p>
    As always in the book, masterfully evocative of that certain kind of coziness.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
But Coziness is just one of many emotions so deeply and masterfully evoked in the book.
Another is the Thoreauvian pleasure of meeting a stranger in the woods.
</p>

<p>
My father used to quote Thoreau's statement that it's always good to meet someone in the woods.
My father used to observe the fact therein subtly implied: it's <i>rare</i> to truly meet someone in the woods.
And by the woods, what's mean is "uncharted" woods: off trails and not around any particular monuments or attractions in nature
</p>

<p>
Having grown up in a very rural area of Maine, surrounded by forests, I can confirm this.
One can generally walk all day in the woods without meeting a soul, even in beautifully-kept public forests.
As Thoreau observed in his essay "Walking", most people travel nearly solely upon the beaten paths. --TODO: add citation
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
Another such emotion is the sparkling wonder of a pristine forest stream, serendipitously discovered.
As I recall, Sam discovers a stream, fed by a natural spring, near the tree that becomes his home.
</p>

or this:
Five notches into June, my house was done. I could stand in it, lie down in
it, and there was room left over for a stump to sit on. On warm evenings I
would lie on my stomach and look out the door, listen to the frogs and
nighthawks, and hope it would storm so that I could crawl into my tree and
be dry. I had gotten soaked during a couple of May downpours, and now
that my house was done, I wanted the chance to sit in my hemlock and
watch a cloudburst wet everything but me. This opportunity didn’t come for
a long time. It was dry.

or this:
‘Today I rafted out into the deep pools of the creek to fish. It was a
lazy sort of autumn day, the sky clear, the leaves beginning to brighten, the
air warm. I stretched out on my back because the fish weren’t biting, and
hummed.

or this:
With Christmas over, the winter became serious. The snows deepened, the
wind blew, the temperatures dropped until the air snapped and talked. Never
had humanity seemed so far away as it did in those cold still months of
January, February, and March. I wandered the snowy crags, listening to the
language of the birds by day and to the noises of the weather by night. The
wind howled, the snow avalanched, and the air creaked.

I slept, ate, played my reed whistle, and talked to Frightful.
To be relaxed, warm, and part of the winter wilderness is an
unforgettable experience. I was in excellent condition. Not a cold, not a
sniffle, not a moment of fatigue. I enjoyed the feeling that I could eat, sleep
and be warm, and outwit the storms that blasted the mountains and the
subzero temperatures that numbed them.

<hr/>

<p>
The book is a mesmerizing work of art. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
</p>

<p>
This is the author's preface for the book: Ms. George's description of the process of writing and publishing "My Side of the Mountain":
<blockquote>
<p>
When I was in elementary school, I packed my suitcase and told my mother I was going to run away from home.
As I envisioned it, I would live by a waterfall in the woods and catch fish on hooks made from the forks of tree limbs, as I had been taught by my father.
I would walk among the wildflowers and trees, listen to the birds, read the weather report in the clouds and the wind, and stride down mountainsides independent and free.
Wisely, my mother did not try to dissuade me. She had been through this herself.
She checked my bag to see if I had my toothbrush and a postcard to let her know how I was getting along, and kissed me good-by.
Forty minutes later I was home.
When my daughter, Twig, was in elementary school, she told me she was going to run away to the woods.
I checked her backpack for her toothbrush and watched her go down the front steps, her shoulders squared confidently.
I blew her a kiss and sat down to wait. Presently, she was back.
Although wishing to run to the woods and live on our own seems to be an inherited characteristic in our family, we are not unique.
Almost everyone I know has dreamed at some time of running away to a distant mountain or island, castle or sailing ship, to live there in beauty and peace.
Few of us make it, however.
</p>

<p>
It is one thing to wish to go, and another matter to do it. I might have
been able to do what Sam Gribley does in this book—live off the land,
make a home, survive by wits and library research, for I had the knowledge.
My father, who was a naturalist and scientist, taught me the plants and
animals of eastern forests and showed me where the wild edible fruits and
tubers grew. On weekends along the Potomac River near Washington, D.C.,
where I was born and grew up, he and I boiled water in leaves and made
rabbit traps. Together we made tables and chairs out of saplings bound with
the braided inner bark of the basswood tree. My brothers, two of the first
falconers in the United States, helped me in the training of a falcon. I had
the know-how for surviving in the woods; and yet I came home.
'But not Sam,' I said to myself when I sat down at my typewriter and
began putting on paper this story, one that I had been writing in my head for
many, many years.
</p>

The writing came easily—Sam needed a home. I remembered a huge
tree my brothers had camped in on an island in the Potomac River. A tree
would be Sam’s home. And I knew how he would survive when foraging
became tough. ‘A falcon will be his provider,’ I said to myself.
With ideas coming fast, the first draft was done in two weeks. Five
revisions later, it was finished and off to the publisher. Back came a phone
call from Sharon Bannigan, the editor of E. P. Dutton’s children’s book
department at that time.
‘Elliott Macrae, the publisher,’ she said, ‘won’t print the book. He
says parents should not encourage their kids to leave home.’
Discouraged, I hung up the phone and walked out into the woods
behind the house. As always when I am in the wildwood, I very quickly
forgot what was troubling me. A sentinel crow was protecting its flock by
watching the sky for hawks; a squirrel was building a nest of leaves for the
winter; a spider was tapping out a message to his mate on a line of her web.
Better to run to the woods than the city, I thought. Here, there is the
world to occupy the mind.

The telephone rang. Sharon Bannigan was back on the wire, and she
was almost singing. Elliott Macrae had changed his mind. And what, I
asked her, had worked the miracle?
‘I simply told him it is better to have children run to the woods than
the city,’ she said. ‘He thought about that. Since he has a home in the wilds
of the Adirondack Mountains and goes off there alone himself, he suddenly
understood your book. My Side of the Mountain will be published in the
spring of ’59.’
From that date to this, I have been answering children’s letters about
Sam. Most want to know if he is a real person. Some, convinced that he is,
have biked to Delhi, New York, from as far away as Long Island, New
York, to find his tree, his falcon, weasel, and raccoon. To these and all
others who ask, I say, 'There is no real Sam, except inside me.' His
adventures are the fulfillment of that day long ago when I told my mother I
was going to run away, got as far as the edge of the woods, and came back.
Perhaps Sam will fulfill your dreams, too. Be you writer or reader, it is very
pleasant to run away in a book.

<p>
As a kid I believe I also read "On the Far Side of the Mountain", which is the sequel to "My Side of the Mountain".
For both books, the saying about people one meets in life comes to mind: I can't remember everything that was said, but I'll always remember how they made me feel.

The "realism of reality" idea is something the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Tracy Kidder often talks about.<br/><br/>

For example:
<blockquote>
A lot of the job of a person trying to write stories that are true is to make
what’s true believable. It isn’t enough to say, well, it actually happened. You
have to make it believable on the page; you have to bring people to life and
scenes to life.<br/>

-Tracy Kidder

</p>

<p>
Tracy Kidder writes nonfiction books - biographies and such - but it's a similar principle. Embedding the life of a famous person in the grittiness of the real world somehow enhances their greatness and makes for a captivating read.

It makes real how it was perhaps possible that you or I could have been that person. Flesh and blood.
