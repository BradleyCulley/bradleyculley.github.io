    I got interested in Bruce Lee in around 2008.
    Honestly he's so cool it was easy to get interested.
</p>

<p>
    In the summer of 2008, I bought one of his books, <i>Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i>. 
    I have a memory of reading <i>Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i> while waiting to get a haircut on Spring Street, the main street where I went to college.
</p>

<p>
    I kind of skipped around in <i>Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i> and don't think I read every word.
    It was good though.
</p>

<p>
    It's apparently the best-selling martial arts book in the world:
    <blockquote>
    Compiled from Bruce Lee's notes and essays and originally published in 1975, Tao of Jeet Kune Do is the best-selling martial arts book in the world
    </blockquote>

Around that time, inspired by Bruce Lee, I trained for fingertips-only push-ups:

The idea of Lee's that's stayed with me the most is martial arts as a means of honestly expressing oneself.
To quote Lee:
<blockquote>
to me, ultimately martial art means honestly expressing yourself
</blockquote>

<p>
    <b>A lot of things in life are about honestly expressing yourself.</b>
    TODO: look up the studies and rework this: Dr. Gabor Maté has popularized the scientific discovery that women who express themselves, and especially, who express their anger when they experience anger, are both less likely to contract breast cancer and more likely to survive breast cancer if they do contract it.
</p>

<p>
I often ask people, "are you doing any kind of creative self-expression?".
It tends to catch people off guard, to incur some deep thought; rather like the question "are you happy?".
</p>

<p>
I don't ask it with negative intent.
It's like a vitamin deficiency.
Like a forkful of well-cooked spinach, once you think about it, you realize you'd really <i>like</i> to be directly and honestly expressing yourself.
</p>

In his 1,267,06-word novel, <i>In Search of Lost Time (À la recherche du temps perdu)</i>, published between 1913 and 1927 the narrator, a thinly disguised proxy the author, Marcel Proust, searches for the meaning of life, with perhaps an oddly specific definition.
The definition is, as per the title of the novel, to solve the problem of lost time; to reclaim lost time.
Lost time is those years lost in apparent meaninglessness, incorrect decisions, failures, and so on.
It's a feeling many of us have experienced: life could have gone differently; it could have been so different — so much better.
 
After much searching, the narrator comes to the perhaps surprising conclusion that the answer is art.
In particular, that one can transmute the pain, grief, and loss of lost time through using those experiences as the basis upon which to create art.
A sort of artistic alchemy of sublimation.

<blockquote>
"Returning to the prior circumstances of his life in order to translate them into a work of art is the means by which the Narrator reclaims the time lost in years gone by.
The Narrator comes to discover that time he thought wasted, in frivolous society or in love, now comes to represent the materials from which he will compose his art."
</blockquote>

It is perhaps the single most wonderful idea I have ever encountered.
</p>

<blockquote>
Proust’s work is distinctively his own, but at the same time it makes visible the
conflicting mentalities that bridged the mechanization of slaughter in WWI. His work
encapsulates a range of reactions to nostalgia for a better historical moment, as well as nostalgia
for a different experience of time itself – as fulfilled and meaningful, rather than the site of
incomprehensible losses. Proust’s lesson is that art must replace god as the force that answers our
fundamental human problems. Our wanting must take the form of desire, because only desire
allows the artist to fully subsume his object in the pursuit of a mode of representation that can
respond to the terror of dying. Proust’s work experiments with the precariousness of love, but
finds it intolerable – the border that enables love’s joy yawns too darkly with the inevitable
death. Although Proust’s friendships and his reactions to contemporary political events indicate
that he privileged trust and human kindness in his life, how his aesthetic conclusions belie the
same desirous nostalgic force that drove the history of the 20th century.

<p>
    Often we settle for indirectly expressing ourselves, via our work, via our influence on our children, and so on.
    The problem is that those things, while very important, by their nature do not permit full artistic expressivity, exact control of the artwork, a guarantee that the art will be experienced by others, nor a short feedback cycle with the audience.
    Painting a painting then sharing it gives all four.
</p>

<p>
    Coming back to Bruce Lee, Bruce Lee succeeded wonderfully in genuinely expressing himself.
    Lee had a positive authenticity that I think people could sense immediately.
    In the interview with Pierre Berton referenced above, for example, you can sort of feel Berton sensing and appreciating Lee's authenticity, and showing Lee respect in return.
    --TODO: watch the full interview, and add a link to the full interview, which is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk1lzkH-e4U
</p>

<p>

</p>
    To me, Lee also represents a fine example of the concomitance of philosophical ideation and concrete implementation.
    Lee took formal coursework in philosophy at the University of Washington, and also studied intellectual topics in a wide-ranging manner outside of school.
    He then took those ideas and put them into practice, as art: films, poetry, books, martial arts.
</p>

<p>
Jeet Kune Do is his own martial art, and philosophy, that he created out of both his learnings and his practical experimentations.
--TODO: add the note here about the other martial arts and/or ideas that influenced Jeet Kune Do
The book has both philosophy and things such as diagrams of actual physical stances and movements to employ in combat.
</p>

<p>
While best known for martial arts and his films, Lee was multifactorially extraordinarily impressive.
As discussed here, he was a true artist.
His Daughter, Shannon Lee, put it well: "He did write poetry; he was really the consummate artist." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee
He successfully acted in dozens of films, starting from early in childhood, yet avoided the typical curse of childhood stardom.
He was a serious practical combat fighter, and was also a great family man - well-remembered by his wife, for example.
--TODO find sources for him being well-remembered by his wife, daughter, son, and/or any other family members that have spoken about the matter
</p>

As a serious fighter, he was a boxing champion in Hong Kong as a young man. In his youth, he became involved in gang-related conflicts.
As part of one such conflict, he beat another young man so badly in a street fight that he knocked one of the guy's teeth out.

Notably, however, he exited the gang life, and street fighting, and focused on what were ultimately peace-building activities, such as philosophy, art, and self-improvement.
This gets to a core idea of why we tend to admire people: those who have power but don't abuse it.
Any schmoe can be peaceful, but it's different when someone turns from violence to peace, especially when they're still capable of violence, and a warrior at heart.

A possible commonality between philosophy and combat is essentialism.
A street fight gets to some core aspects of human, and even animal, nature.
If you continually click the first link on Wikipedia, you'll eventually end up on the page for philosophy, no matter where you start.
See this for a fascinating explanation of the "Wikipedia link rule" about philosophy: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-llumS2rA8I)

Add to the Bruce Lee essay that philosophy is the only subject whose name speaks to love. In other words you study or practice all the other subjects because they have some instrumental value for example chemistry has an instrumental value, And well you may find or discover a love of chemistry it's perhaps actually philosophy that you're discovering with in chemistry and what you really love is the knowledge or the wisdom that you see in a way through a lens of love in chemistry. But philosophy is entirely about the love knowledge or wisdom.

Bruce Lee also understood and put into practice the essential importance of family. Accounts he had great relationships with both his wife and her son and both of them remember him fondly and speak well of him.

This photo of Bruce Lee in his casket that has really stayed with me: TODO add photo (https://i0.wp.com/.../2015/11/Brucelee11-Khurki.net_.jpg...). All of that ambition and discipline and drive and talent and energy and good character were simply gone, without reason.

I once heard an interview where the person, speaking of mind uploading, said that in the future we'll look back at the current era with astonishment. The era in which we carried around something as precious as our entire mind in this biological vessel - subject to innumerable, and sometimes unexpected, risks of complete loss. We do better with our hard drives.

Nonexistence is perhaps especially incongruous and inexplicable when someone young dies so suddenly. Even more so when they're a great person, like Bruce Lee. Oumou Sangare has a song title that captures this well: [Saa Magna - "Death is Terrible"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_YyroDeZrY).

Rather than focus on the tragedy of his early death, perhaps it's best to focus on how thoughtful, deep, and self-disciplined he was — to be able to identify, and so profoundly fulfill, such essential aspects of life within his short time on this planet.
