Tao of Jeet Kune Do, by Bruce Lee

------------------------------
<p>
    Bruce Lee was a great man who died far too young.
    To paraphrase Thoreau, he lived deliberately fronting only the essential facts of life. -https://www.gutenberg.org/files/205/205-h/205-h.htm
</p>

<p>
    I got interested in Bruce Lee in around 2008.
    Honestly Bruce Lee is so cool it was pretty easy to get interested.
</p>

<p>
    In the summer of 2008, I bought one of his books, <i>Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i>. 
    I have a memory of reading <i>Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i> while waiting to get a haircut on Spring Street, the main street of the town where I went to college.
</p>

<p>
    Kinda skipped around in the book and don't think I read every word. It was good.
    It wasn't for school or a group or anything - was just interested.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i> is apparently the best-selling martial arts book in the world:
    <blockquote>
    Compiled from Bruce Lee's notes and essays and originally published in 1975, Tao of Jeet Kune Do is the best-selling martial arts book in the world
    </blockquote>

Inspired by Lee, I trained for fingertips-only push-ups:

<p>
The idea of Bruce Lee's that's stayed with me the most is the idea of martial arts as a means of honestly expressing oneself.
He said this in an interview: "to me, ultimately martial art means honestly expressing yourself". -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2clpHtV1iA
</p>

A lot of things are about honestly expressing yourself. I cannot emphasize that enough, so I will say it again: A lot of things are about honestly expressing yourself.

Dr. Gabor Maté has popularized the research-based finding that women who express themselves, and especially, who express their anger when they experience anger, are both less likely to contract breast cancer, and more likely to survive breast cancer if they do contract it.

TODO: find the timestamp within this video in which Mate says that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6IL8WVyMMs

Add the proust, In Search of Lost Time, piece, about self-expression being the loophole the purpose of life 

Add thing about asking people if there any doing any kind of creative stuff expression to the Bruce Lee essay

I think Bruce Lee very much succeeded in genuineness expressing himself. He had a positive genuineness that I think people could sense. In the above interview, for example, you can king of perceive the interviewer sensing his genuineness, and appreciating it.  

To me, he also represents a fine example of the confluence of philosophy and practice. He took formal coursework in philosophy at the University of Washington. He also studied intellectual topics in a wide-ranging manner outside of school.

Jeet Kune Do is his own martial art, and philosophy, that he created out of both his learnings and his practical experimentations. The book has both philosophy and things such as diagrams of actual physical stances and movements to employ in combat.

Add the thumb tip push-ups to the Bruce Lee essay

While best known for martial arts and his films, he was very multifactorially impressive. For example, he wrote poetry as another means of expressing himself. He successfully acted in dozens of films, starting from early in childhood, yet avoided the typical curse of childhood stardom. He was a serious practical combat fighter, and was also a great family man - well-remembered by his wife, for example.

As a serious fighter, he was a boxing champion in Hong Kong as a young man. In his youth, he became involved in gang-related conflicts.
As part of one such conflict, he beat another young man so badly in a street fight that he knocked one of the guy's teeth out.

Notably, however, he exited the gang life, and street fighting, and focused on what were ultimately peace-building activities, such as philosophy, art, and self-improvement.
This gets to a core idea of why we tend to admire people: those who have power but don't abuse it.
Any schmoe can be peaceful, but it's different when someone turns from violence to peace, especially when they're still capable of violence, and a warrior at heart.

A possible commonality between philosophy and combat is essentialism.
A street fight gets to some core aspects of human, and even animal, nature.
If you continually click the first link on Wikipedia, you'll eventually end up on the page for philosophy, no matter where you start.
See this for a fascinating explanation of the "Wikipedia link rule" about philosophy: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-llumS2rA8I)

Add to the Bruce Lee essay that philosophy is the only subject whose name speaks to love. In other words you study or practice all the other subjects because they have some instrumental value for example chemistry has an instrumental value, And well you may find or discover a love of chemistry it's perhaps actually philosophy that you're discovering with in chemistry and what you really love is the knowledge or the wisdom that you see in a way through a lens of love in chemistry. But philosophy is entirely about the love knowledge or wisdom.

Bruce Lee also understood and put into practice the essential importance of family. Accounts he had great relationships with both his wife and her son and both of them remember him fondly and speak well of him.

There is a photo of Bruce Lee in his casket that has really stayed with me (https://i0.wp.com/.../2015/11/Brucelee11-Khurki.net_.jpg...). All of that ambition and discipline and drive and talent and energy and good character were simply gone, without reason.

I once heard an interview where the person, speaking of mind uploading, said that in the future we'll look back at the current era with astonishment. The era in which we carried around something as precious as our entire mind in this biological vessel - subject to innumerable, and sometimes unexpected, risks of complete loss. We do better with our hard drives.

Nonexistence is perhaps especially incongruous and inexplicable when someone young dies so suddenly. Even more so when they're a great person, like Bruce Lee. Oumou Sangare has a song title that captures this well: [Saa Magna - "Death is Terrible"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_YyroDeZrY).

Rather than focus on the tragedy of his early death, perhaps it's best to focus on how thoughtful, deep, and self-disciplined he was — to be able to identify, and so profoundly fulfill, such essential aspects of life within his short time on this planet.
