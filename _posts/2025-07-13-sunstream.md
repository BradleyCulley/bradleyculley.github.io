    I had had an extremely stressful senior year of college.
</p>

<p>
    In June, 2011, I graduated.
    That summer, my mind was decompressing from that final year of college.
</p>

<p>
    One of the characteristics of the decompression was a feeling of expansiveness.
    It was like standing at the edge of a vast landscape; a prairie or a mountain range, maybe.
</p>

<p>
    It was an internal experience, with me wherever I went.
    It had both a vastness and a stillness to it.
</p>

<p>
    I worked at a summer camp that summer.
    I taught tennis, looked after the campers, and lived right on the campus of the boarding school at which the camp took place.
</p>

<p>
    The boarding school is called Kents Hill School, located in Kents Hill, Maine.
    Completely coincidentally, it's where my sister went to high school.
</p>

<p>
    I took the photo at the top of this post on the campus that summer, with a flip phone as I recall.
    I also took these:

    I wrote the below poem that summer, I believe.
    I don't remember if I wrote it while working at the camp, or during time spent at my childhood home in Maine that summer.
    I think it may have been the latter.
</p>

<p>
    There's a memory, somehow connected to this poem, of being on the porch of my childhood home...perhaps of having just seen the sun through the leaves, as described in the poem.
    Whichever place it was, there was that feeling of expansiveness, and of the sunlight — as the poem describes — streaming into me, so to speak.

<b style="font-size: 20px;">Sunstream</b><br/><br/>

The sun I saw through the trees today<br/>
lit my mind on fire<br/>
and burned its radiance through my soul<br/><br/>

The evening light gave the finest shade<br/>
to the leaves through which it shone,<br/>
and that burning globe was the perfect backdrop<br/>
for their patterned shaking<br/><br/>

How orange, how soft and cool in its brightness,<br/>
and how deep the shade of green<br/>
was of the leaves<br/><br/>

I stood struck, in mute discourse with the setting sun<br/>
possessed by its luminousness,<br/>
forever transfixed,<br/>
yet always restful in its glow<br/><br/>
