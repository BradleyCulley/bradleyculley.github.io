<p>
    I had an intense senior year of college. The summer after, my mind was decompressing.
</p>

<p>
    Part of the decompression was a feeling of spaciousness and joy.
    It was like standing at the edge of a vast landscape.
</p>

<p>
    That summer, I worked at a summer camp teaching tennis and lived on the campus of the boarding school at which the camp took place.
</p>

<p>
    Some photos I took that summer:

    Below is an updated version of a poem I wrote that summer.
    It wasn't for a class or a group or anything...just felt like writing it.
    I don't recall if I wrote it while working at the camp or during time spent at my childhood home in Maine that summer.
</p>

<p>
    There's a memory, somehow connected to the poem, of being on the porch of my childhood home that summer...and I think of having, as the poem describes, just seen the sun shining through the leaves.
    With that memory, too, there was the spaciousness and the joy.
    And there was the feeling of the sunlight, as the poem describes, streaming into me, so to speak.

The sun I saw through the trees today<br/>
lit my mind on fire<br/>
and burned its radiance through my soul<br/><br/>

The evening light gave the finest shade<br/>
to the leaves through which it shone,<br/>
and that burning globe was the perfect backdrop<br/>
for their patterned shaking<br/><br/>

How orange, how soft and cool in its brightness,<br/>
and how deep the shade of green<br/>
was of the leaves<br/><br/>

I stood struck, in mute discourse with the setting sun<br/>
possessed by its luminousness,<br/>
forever transfixed,<br/>
yet ever restful in its glow<br/><br/>
