<p>
    I had an intense senior year of college.
</p>

<p>
    That summer, my mind was decompressing.
</p>

<p>
    Part of the decompression was a feeling of expansiveness and joy.
    It was like standing at the edge of a vast landscape: an expansive prairie or a mountain range, perhaps.
    It sort of welled up from inside me, and more strongly so at certain times.
</p>

<p>
    I worked at a summer camp that summer: teaching tennis, looking after the campers, and living on the campus of the boarding school at which the camp took place.
</p>

<p>
    The boarding school is Kents Hill School, located in Kents Hill, Maine.
    Completely coincidentally, it's where my sister went to high school.
</p>

<p>
    I took the photo at the top of this post on the campus that summer.
    I also took these:

    Below is an updated version of a poem I wrote that summer.
    It wasn't for a class or a group or anything. I just felt like writing it.
    I don't remember if I wrote it while working at the camp, or during time spent at my childhood home in Maine.
</p>

<p>
    There's a memory, somehow connected to the poem, of being on the porch of my childhood home...perhaps of having just seen the sun through the leaves, as the poem describes.
    There was that feeling of expansiveness and joy, and of the sunlight, as the poem describes, streaming into me, so to speak.

The sun I saw through the trees today<br/>
lit my mind on fire<br/>
and burned its radiance through my soul<br/><br/>

The evening light gave the finest shade<br/>
to the leaves through which it shone,<br/>
and that burning globe was the perfect backdrop<br/>
for their patterned shaking<br/><br/>

How orange, how soft and cool in its brightness,<br/>
and how deep the shade of green<br/>
was of the leaves<br/><br/>

I stood struck, in silent discourse with the setting sun<br/>
possessed by its luminousness,<br/>
forever transfixed,<br/>
yet ever restful in its glow<br/><br/>
