<p>
    I had an intense senior year of college.
</p>

<p>
    That summer, my mind was decompressing.
</p>

<p>
    Part of the decompression was a feeling of spaciousness and joy.
    It was like standing at the edge of a vast landscape.
</p>

<p>
    I worked at a summer camp: teaching tennis, looking after the campers, and living on the campus of the boarding school at which the camp took place.
</p>

<p>
    I took the photo at the top of this post at the camp that summer, and these as well:

    Below is an updated version of a poem I wrote that summer.
    It wasn't for a class or a group or anything...just felt like writing it.
    Can't recall if I wrote it while working at the camp, or during time spent that summer at my childhood home in Maine.
</p>

<p>
    There's a memory, somehow connected to the poem, of being on the porch of my childhood home...perhaps of having, as the poem describes, just seen the sun through the leaves.
    With the memory, there was the spaciousness and the joy.
    And there was the feeling of the sunlight, as the poem describes, streaming into me, so to speak.

The sun I saw through the trees today<br/>
lit my mind on fire<br/>
and burned its radiance through my soul<br/><br/>

The evening light gave the finest shade<br/>
to the leaves through which it shone,<br/>
and that burning globe was the perfect backdrop<br/>
for their patterned shaking<br/><br/>

How orange, how soft and cool in its brightness,<br/>
and how deep the shade of green<br/>
was of the leaves<br/><br/>

I stood struck, in mute discourse with the setting sun<br/>
possessed by its luminousness,<br/>
forever transfixed,<br/>
yet ever restful in its glow<br/><br/>
