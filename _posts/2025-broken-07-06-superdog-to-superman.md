Superdog to Superman

He sits above me on a pillar
in The Fortress of Solitude.

“Why build a Fortress of Solitude”, I say,
“when you’re so alone, right now?”.
“Solitude is my nature”

I’m stretched out below him,
amid the icy peaks.
I claw little furrows into the frost.

“You could fight crime without the Superman costume, you know”
“Many things I can do here, Superdog.”

“So then why?  Why play Clark?”

He smoothes a wrinkle near his knee. He sighs.
“The Kent disguise allows me to be with the people.”
“The people?” I ask.

“People don’t keep their firefighters
under their sinks”.
He looks down at me
the edges of a frown on that stony jaw.

“Lois Lane knows this place, this ‘Fortress’, Superman”, I say.
“Truth, Justice…”, he says.

“She’ll die, you know”
“You could fly her to the Rose Nebula”, I say,
“but the trip would take a thousand years”.

He snaps his eyes straight ahead. He begins, “My father, Jor-El, sent me to this planet. He gave me a mission…”.
I cut him off with a whisper. He stares, perfectly still up there.

It’s the speech. The only words from his parents.
He listens to it every night,
from the crystals.
