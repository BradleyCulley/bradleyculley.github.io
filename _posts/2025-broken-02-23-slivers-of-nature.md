My father used to say that places like the sliver of forest at the edge of a parking lot are somehow more wild than even deep wilderness.
</p>

<p>
From late 2018 to early 2020, I lived and worked in Northeastern Virginia.
A nice aspect of that area is the miniature parks sprinkled through the suburban neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
While living there, I chanced across a video of a person walking in the rain through a park, and that park randomly turned out to be right nearby.
The park is Pimmit View Park in Falls Church, Virginia.
This is the video (click the image to open the video in a new tab):

</p>

More photos of the park:
<add a few photos of the park>
<add the screenshot of the person giving the location of the park>

I walked the circuit just as you can see in the video.
Much of the magic was that, as one can see in the video, there were residential homes all around.
It was like being in a backyard tree fort: both near to people and somehow in another world.

Later, I walked through one of those Northeastern Virginia parks with my father.
Looking back, it's perhaps no accident, but rather shared inclination, that that's what we did together, rather than, say, going to a museum.
A sign we came across in the park:

<p>
About 5 years earlier, I lived and worked in the Binghamton, New York area.
At a certain point, I found this park:
<add image of the park here>
</p>

<p>
It's called "Canine Commons Dog Park". It's a dog park and I've never had a dog, but I went anyway.
</p>

<p>
This is the entrance to the park.
The surroundings are as unremarkable as can be, which somehow supported the feeling of divinity to the place.

</p>

<p>
I found a small path leading from the park's main road to a stream just below. 
The stream was fairly hidden from the roads that ran parallel to it, and just a few yards away, on both sides.
There's a highway on the one side and the main road inside the park on the other.
You can see the layout here:

</p>

<p>
Down at the steam, I'd often sit in a natural seat formed by the roots of a tree on the streambank.
I took this photo from near the tree:<br/>

</p>

<p>
The streambed mesmerized me — the elegance of the rocks and the water.
This is a photo from I think the seat with the roots itself, or very close by:<br/>

I think the branches running across the photo are the branches of the tree with the branches seat.
</p>

<p>
I think a lot of people have a sort of refuge like this.
Perhaps courtyard where they take their lunch break, or their garden at home where they relax after a long day.
</p>

<p>
When you sit in such a place as that streambed, you see a world of fractals: stones, leaves, patterns in the water.

Perhaps remove:
A former coworker — who was from to the area originally — once called Binghamton "a cesspool of drugs and debauchery" (which is kind of funny, but he wasn't wrong).
Around the apartment in which I lived, there was constant criminal activity, police activity, and all-around bad behavior.
</p>

<p>
There's a certain contrast of such a beautiful place with such a troubled town.
Similarly, the idea of a sliver of nature embodies a contrast between, say, the rear parking lot of a restaurant, with its loading dock and dumpsters, and the small tranquil group of pine trees just beyond the edge of the asphalt.
</p>

<p>
Years later, I was recollecting the streambed and decided to navigate with Google Maps's street view until I found the park.
When I finally navigated to it and realized I'd found it - Canine Commons Dog Park - I felt an emotion akin to transcendence in the midst of the uglier side of everyday life.
</p>

<p>
I once saw it put that if life were a video game, the review would be "the graphics are amazing but the plot makes no sense".
Contemplating the streambed in Binghamton brings up the question, in the largest sense possible, of what exactly is going on here in this universe?
</p>

Talk about my father's fascination with Van Cortland Park (and the "Bronx Woods" and Central Park?), and how he created at his home in Maine an area that mimics that biome, as I recall.

Talk about the Denis swimming pool and [was it a country club] at night?

Maybe mention the David Foster Wallace essay about the actuary, who uses the little park area outside the office something like "rather like a ship's captain uses the stars to navigate" (look up the exact quote).

Talk about Shankha Park in Kathmandu

I think many people find and get great satisfactions from places like this

Good even mention Foucault's idea of "heterotopias":
<blockquote>
Heterotopia is a concept elaborated by philosopher Michel Foucault to describe certain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow "other": disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming.
Heterotopias are "worlds within worlds": both similar to their surroundings, and contrasting with or upsetting them.
</blockquote>
