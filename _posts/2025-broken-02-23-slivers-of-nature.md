My father used to say that places like the strips of forest at the edges of parking lots are somehow more wild than even places deep in true wilderness.

Around 2012-2014, I used to live and work in the Binghamton, New York area.
At a certain point, I found this a park near where I lived:
<add image of the park here>

It's named Canine Commons Dog Park, and I'm not a dog, but I didn't let that stop me.

This is the entrance to the park. As unremarkable of an area as can be, which somehow facilitated the feeling of divinity.

I found a small path leading from the park's main road to a river just below.
The riven was more or less fully hidden from the road.
Once down at the river, I would, as I recall, sit in a sort of natural seat created by the roots of a tree that grew right by the riverside.

When you're sitting by a river bank you see a world of fractals: stones, leaves, patterns in the water.
The mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot discovered this fact about nature: its patterns are fractals.

Probably remove this part: the writing advice to be positive, not negative!
Sitting in that utter beauty, in a town (Binghamton) that my coworker at a nearby restaurant — a local to the area — once called "a cesspool of drugs and debauchery", one has to wonder.
One has to wonder, in the largest sense possible, what's going on here on this planet?
I once heard it put that if life were a video game, the review would be "the graphics are amazing but the plot makes no sense." --TODO: try to find citation

About 5 years later, I lived and worked in Northeastern Virginia.
One of the unique aspects of Northeastern Virginia is the miniature parks sprinkled through the expanse of suburbs around the greater Fairfax area.
I used to really enjoy spending time in these parks.

I happened to see this video of walking through a park that randomly turned out to be right nearby in Virginia.
This is the park (click the image to open the video — opens in a new tab:

I went there and walked the circuit in the park seen in the video.

Much of the magic was that, as one can see in the video, there were residential homes all around the park.
It was like being in a backyard tree fort: both near to people and somehow away from it all.

I once walked through once of those Northeastern Virginia parks with my father. We enjoyed this sign in the park:

Talk about my father's fascination with Van Cortland Park (and the "Bronx Woods" and Central Park?), and how he created at his home in Maine an area that mimics that biome, as I recall.

Talk about the Denis swimming pool and [was it a country club] at night?

Maybe mention the David Foster Wallace essay about the actuary, who uses the little park area outside the office something like "rather like a ship's captain uses the stars to navigate" (look up the exact quote).

Talk about Shankha Park in Kathmandu

I think many people have places like this. Sanctuaries from the world.

Good even mention Foucault's idea of "heterotopias":
<blockquote>
Heterotopia is a concept elaborated by philosopher Michel Foucault to describe certain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow "other": disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming.
Heterotopias are "worlds within worlds": both similar to their surroundings, and contrasting with or upsetting them.
