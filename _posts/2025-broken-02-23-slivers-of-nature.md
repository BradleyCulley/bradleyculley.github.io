My father used to say hat places like the sliver of forest at the edge of parking lots are somehow more wild than even places deep in the wilderness.

Around 2012-2014, I lived and worked in the Binghamton, New York area.
At a certain point, I found this park:
<add image of the park here>

It's called "Canine Commons Dog Park". It's a dog park and I've never had a dog, but I checked it out anyway.

This is the entrance to the park. As unremarkable as can be, which somehow supported the feelings of divinity to in the park.

I found a small path leading from the park's main road to a stream just below. 
The stream was pretty much hidden from the roads that ran parallel to it, and just a few yards away, on both sides.
Once down at the steam, I would often sit in a sort of natural seat formed by the roots of a tree by the riverside.
I took this photo from near that tree:<br/>

I was mesmerized by the streambed — the elegance of the rocks and the water.
Some photos I took:<br/>

That last photo was I think from right at or right near the tree with the roots that formed a seat.

When you sit in such a place, you see a world of fractals: stones, leaves, patterns in the water.
I once saw it put that if life were a video game, the review would be "the graphics are amazing but the plot makes no sense." --TODO: try to find citation

About 5 years later, I lived and worked in Northeastern Virginia.
One of the unique aspects of Northeastern Virginia is the miniature parks sprinkled through the expanse of suburbs around the greater Fairfax area.
I used to really enjoy spending time in these parks.

I happened to see this video of walking through a park that randomly turned out to be right nearby in Virginia.
This is the park (click the image to open the video — opens in a new tab:

More photos of the park:

I went there and walked the circuit in the park seen in the video.

Much of the magic was that, as one can see in the video, there were residential homes all around the park.
It was like being in a backyard tree fort: both near to people and somehow away from it all.

I once walked through once of those Northeastern Virginia parks with my father. We enjoyed this sign in the park:
<add the photo from the park, and work to figure out which park it was, if I can>



<add a photo of the mandelbrot set>

The mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot discovered this fact about nature: its patterns tend to be fractals.


Probably remove this part: the writing advice to be positive, not negative!
Sitting in that utter beauty, in a town (Binghamton) that my coworker at a nearby restaurant — a local to the area — once called "a cesspool of drugs and debauchery", one has to wonder.
One has to wonder, in the largest sense possible, what's going on here on this planet?

Talk about my father's fascination with Van Cortland Park (and the "Bronx Woods" and Central Park?), and how he created at his home in Maine an area that mimics that biome, as I recall.

Talk about the Denis swimming pool and [was it a country club] at night?

Maybe mention the David Foster Wallace essay about the actuary, who uses the little park area outside the office something like "rather like a ship's captain uses the stars to navigate" (look up the exact quote).

Talk about Shankha Park in Kathmandu

I think many people have places like this. Sanctuaries from the world.

Good even mention Foucault's idea of "heterotopias":
<blockquote>
Heterotopia is a concept elaborated by philosopher Michel Foucault to describe certain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow "other": disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming.
Heterotopias are "worlds within worlds": both similar to their surroundings, and contrasting with or upsetting them.
</blockquote>
