<p>
My father used to say that places like the sliver of forest at the edge of a parking lot are somehow more wild than even deep wilderness.
</p>

<p>
From late 2018 to early 2020, I lived and worked in Northeastern Virginia.
A nice aspect of Northeastern Virginia is the miniature parks sprinkled through the expanse of suburbs that comprise it.
</p>

<p>
During that time, I chanced across this video of a person walking in the rain through a park, and that park randomly turned out to be right nearby.
It's Pimmit View Park in Falls Church, Virginia.
This is the video (click the image to open the video in a new tab):

</p>

More photos of the park:
<add a few photos of the park>
<add the screenshot of the person giving the location of the park>

I walked the circuit just as you can see in the video.
Much of the magic was that, as one can see in the video, there were residential homes all around.
It was like being in a backyard tree fort: both near to people and somehow in another world.

Later, I walked through on of those Northeastern Virginia parks with my father.
Looking back, it's perhaps no accident, but rather shared inclination, that that was the activity we did together, rather than, say, going to a museum.
A sign we came across in the park:

<p>
About 5 years earlier, I lived and worked in the Binghamton, New York area.
At a certain point, I found this park:
<add image of the park here>
</p>

<p>
It's called "Canine Commons Dog Park". It's a dog park and I've never had a dog, but I went anyway.
</p>

<p>
This is the entrance to the park.
The surroundings are as unremarkable as can be, which somehow supported the feelings of divinity I experienced there.

<p>
I found a small path leading from the park's main road to a stream just below. 
The stream was fairly hidden from the roads that ran parallel to it, and just a few yards away, on both sides: the highway on the one side and the road inside the park on the other.
You can see the layout here:

</p>

<p>
Down at the steam, I would often sit in a sort of natural seat formed by the roots of a tree on the bank of the stream.
I took this photo from near that tree:<br/>

</p>

<p>
I was mesmerized by the streambed — the elegance of the rocks and the water.
This one is I think from right about the seat with the roots itself - the branches running across the photo might be :<br/>

</p>

<p>
When you sit in such a place, you see a world of fractals: stones, leaves, patterns in the water.

Perhaps remove:
A former coworker — who was from to the area originally — once called Binghamton "a cesspool of drugs and debauchery" (he wasn't wrong).
There's a funny paradox of such a beautiful stream in such a troubled surrounding town.
Similarly, a sliver of nature contrasts between, say, the rear parking lot of a restaurant, with its loading dock and dumpsters, and the small tranquil cluster of pine trees just beyond it.
I once saw it put that if life were a video game, the review would be "the graphics are amazing but the plot makes no sense".
Contemplating the streambed in Binghamton brings up the question, in the largest sense possible, of what exactly is going on here in this universe?

Get the photos I took of the park from Flickr

Talk about my father's fascination with Van Cortland Park (and the "Bronx Woods" and Central Park?), and how he created at his home in Maine an area that mimics that biome, as I recall.

Talk about the Denis swimming pool and [was it a country club] at night?

Maybe mention the David Foster Wallace essay about the actuary, who uses the little park area outside the office something like "rather like a ship's captain uses the stars to navigate" (look up the exact quote).

Talk about Shankha Park in Kathmandu

I think many people have places like this. Sanctuaries from the world.

Good even mention Foucault's idea of "heterotopias":
<blockquote>
Heterotopia is a concept elaborated by philosopher Michel Foucault to describe certain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow "other": disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming.
Heterotopias are "worlds within worlds": both similar to their surroundings, and contrasting with or upsetting them.
