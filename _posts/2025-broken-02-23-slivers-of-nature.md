My father used to say that places like the sliver of forest at the edge of a parking lot are somehow more wild than even deep wilderness.
</p>

<p>
From late 2018 to early 2020, I lived and worked in Northeastern Virginia.
A nice aspect of Northeastern Virginia is the miniature parks that are sprinkled through the suburban neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
While living there, I chanced across a video of a person walking in the rain through a park, and the park randomly turned out to be right nearby.
The park is Pimmit View Park in Falls Church, Virginia.
This is the video (click the image to open the video in a new tab):

It's really quite a pleasant short film.
</p>

<p>
More photos of the park:

I walked the circuit just as in the video.
Much of the magic was that, as one can see in the video, there were homes all around.
It was like being in a backyard tree fort: both near to people and in another world.

Later, I walked through one of those Northeastern Virginia parks with my father.
Looking back, it's perhaps no accident, but rather shared inclination, that that's what we did together, rather than, say, going to a museum.
A sign we came across in the park:

About 5 years earlier, I lived and worked in the Binghamton, New York area.
At a certain point, I found this park:
<add image of the park here>
</p>

<p>
It's called "Canine Commons Dog Park". It's a dog park and I've never had a dog, but I went anyway.
</p>

<p>
This is the entrance to the park.
The surroundings are as unremarkable as can be, which somehow supported the feeling of divinity to the place.

<p>
I found a small path leading from the park's main road to a stream just below. 
The stream was fairly hidden from the roads that ran parallel to it, and just a few yards away, on both sides.
There's a highway on one side and the main road inside the park on the other.
You can see the layout here:

</p>

<p>
Down at the steam, I'd often sit in a natural seat formed by the roots of a tree on the streambank.
I took this photo from near the tree:<br/>

</p>

<p>
The streambed mesmerized me; the elegance of the rocks and the water.
This is a photo from I think right at the seat with the roots, or very close by:<br/>

I think the branches running across the photo are the branches of that tree.
</p>

<p>
I think a lot of people have a haven like this.
Perhaps it's the courtyard where they take their lunch break, or their garden at home.
</p>

<p>
When you sit in such a place as that streambed, you see a world of fractals: stones, leaves, patterns in the water.
</p>

<p>
A former coworker — who was from to the area originally — once called Binghamton "a cesspool of drugs and debauchery" (which is kind of funny, but he wasn't wrong).
Binghamton is a classic collapsed former industrial town.
They used to manufacture shoes.
Where I lived, there was constant criminal activity, constant police activity, and constant all-around sketchy behavior.
</p>

<p>
There's a certain contrast to such a beautiful place being in such a troubled town.
Similarly, the idea of a sliver of nature involves the contrast between, say, the rear parking lot of a restaurant — with its loading dock and dumpsters — and the small cluster of pines just beyond the asphalt.
</p>

<p>
Years later, I was thinking back to that streambed and decided to navigate with Google Maps's street view until I found the park.
When Iw found it, I felt a surprisingly strong emotion: something like transcendence amidst the uglier side of everyday life.
