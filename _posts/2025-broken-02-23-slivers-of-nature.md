I used to live in Binghamton, New York, and work nearby.
I found this a park nearby, https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/10830

I used to live and work in Northeastern Virginia.
One of the unique aspects of Northeastern Virginia is there are miniature parks sprinkled through the expanse of suburbs that comprise the greater Fairfax area.
I used to regularly spend time in these parks.

Talk about the slivers of nature. For example, the mini parks in Northern Virginia and how neat they are.
Talk in particular about the one mini park I saw in a video and it turned out to be like 10 minutes from where I lived, so I went there and walked it as was seen in the video.

Link the video of walking in the rain in the one that I posted on Facebook years ago. 
And mention what Dennis said about how places like the edges of parking lots are is some ways more wild than even deep in pure nature, such as the middle of a large forest.` 

Mention the David Foster Wallace essay about the actuary, who uses the little park area outside the office something like "rather like a ship's captain uses the stars to navigate" (look up the exact quote).
Talk about my father's fascination with Van Cortland Park (and the "Bronx Woods" and Central Park?), and how he created an area that mimics that biome, as I recall.

Good even mention Foucault's idea of "heterotopias":
<blockquote>
Heterotopia is a concept elaborated by philosopher Michel Foucault to describe certain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow "other": disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming.
Heterotopias are "worlds within worlds": both similar to their surroundings, and contrasting with or upsetting them.
</blockquote>
