<b>My father used to say places like the sliver of forest at the edge of a parking lot are somehow more wild than even deep wilderness.</b>

<p>
From mid-2018 to early 2020, I lived and worked in Northeastern Virginia.
A nice aspect of Northeastern Virginia is the miniature parks sprinkled through the suburban neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
While living there, I chanced across a video of a person walking in a park in the rain, and the park randomly turned out to be right nearby.
The park is Pimmit View Park in Falls Church, Virginia.
This is the video (click to watch the video in a new tab):<br/>

It's really quite a pleasant film.
</p>

<p>
More photos of the park:

I walked the circuit just as in the video.
Part the magic was that, as seen in the video, there were homes all around.
It was like a backyard tree fort: both near to people and in another world.

</p>

<p>
Later, I walked through one of those Northeastern Virginia mini-parks with my father.
Looking back, it's perhaps no accident, but rather shared inclination, that that's what we did together, rather than, say, going to a museum.
A sign we came across in the park:

<p>
About 5 years earlier, I lived and worked in the Binghamton, New York area.
At a certain point, I found this park:
<iframe
  width="600"
  height="450"
  style="border:0"
  loading="lazy"
  allowfullscreen
  referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
  src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=YOUR_API_KEY
    &q=Canine+Commons+Dog+Park,21+Lewis+Rd,Binghamton+NY+13905">
</iframe>
</p>

<p>
It's "Canine Commons Dog Park". It's a dog park and I've never had a dog, but I went nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
This is the entrance to the park:
<todo add photo of the entrace to the park>
The surroundings are as unremarkable as can be, which somehow supported the feeling of divinity to the place.
TODO: add photo of the entrance of the park.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
I found a small path from the park's main road to a stream just below. 
The stream was fairly hidden from the two roads that ran parallel to it on either side.
There's a highway on one side and the main road inside the park on the other:
TODO: add a screenshot showing the layout, with annotations from Google maps
</p>

<p>
At the stream, I'd often sit in a natural seat formed by the roots of a tree on the streambank.
I took this photo from near the tree:<br/>

</p>

<p>
The streambed mesmerized me; the elegance of the rocks and the water.
I took this one from right at the seat with the roots, or very close by:<br/>
<img src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/Binghamton-Park-3.jpg" />

I think the branches running across the photo are the branches of that tree.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
I think a lot of people have a haven like this.
It might be the courtyard where they take their lunch break, or their garden at home.
</p>

<p>
At the streambed, you see a world of fractals: stones, leaves, patterns in the water.
</p>

<p>
A former coworker — who was from to the area originally — once called Binghamton "a cesspool of drugs and debauchery", which is kind of funny, but he wasn't wrong.
Where I lived, there was constant criminal activity, constant police activity, and constant all-around bad behavior, although still some good people.
</p>

<p>
There's a certain aesthetic contrast of such a beautiful place in such a troubled town.
Similarly, a sliver of nature involves a physical contrast.
That's to say, the contrast between, say, the rear parking lot of a restaurant — with its loading dock and dumpsters — and the tranquil cluster of pines just beyond the asphalt.
</p>

<p>
Years later, I was recollecting the park and decided to find it with Google Maps's street view.
When I finally found it, I experienced a surprisingly strong emotion: something like transcendence amidst the grit of everyday life.
