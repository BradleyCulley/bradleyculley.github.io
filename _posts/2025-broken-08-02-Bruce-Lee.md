Tao of Jeet Kune Do, by Bruce Lee

------------------------------

Read this in the academic year of 2008-2009. Kind of skipped around in the book - not sure if I read all of it. Didn't read it for school or anything - was just personally interested.

It is apparently the best-selling martial arts book in the world:
<blockquote>
Compiled from Bruce Lee's notes and essays and originally published in 1975, Tao of Jeet Kune Do is the best-selling martial arts book in the world

Bruce Lee was a great guy who died far too young.

The biggest takeaway that's stayed with me from Lee's ideas is his idea of martial arts as a means of honestly expressing oneself. He said this in an interview: "to me, ultimately martial art means honestly expressing yourself".

A lot of things are about honestly expressing yourself. I cannot emphasize that enough, so I will say it again: A lot of things are about honestly expressing yourself.

Dr. Gabor Mat√© has popularized the research-based finding that women who express themselves, and especially, who express their anger when they experience anger, are both less likely to contract breast cancer, and more likely to survive breast cancer if they do contract it.

TODO: find the timestamp within this video in which Mate says that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6IL8WVyMMs

I think Bruce Lee very much succeeded in genuineness expressing himself. He had a positive genuineness that I think people could sense. In the above interview, for example, you can king of perceive the interviewer sensing his genuineness, and appreciating it.  

To me, he also represents a fine example of the confluence of philosophy and practice. He took formal coursework in philosophy at the University of Washington. He also studied intellectual topics in a wide-ranging manner outside of school.

Jeet Kune Do is his own martial art, and philosophy, that he created out of both his learnings and his practical experimentations. The book has both philosophy and things such as diagrams of actual physical stances and movements to employ in combat.

While best known for martial arts and his films, he was very multifactorially impressive. For example, he wrote poetry as another means of expressing himself. He successfully acted in dozens of films, starting from early in childhood, yet avoided the typical curse of childhood stardom. He was a serious practical combat fighter, and was also a great family man - well-remembered by his wife, for example.

As a serious fighter, he was a boxing champion in Hong Kong as a young man. In his youth, he became involved in gang-related conflicts.
As part of one such conflict, he beat another young man so badly in a street fight that he knocked one of the guy's teeth out.

Notably, however, he exited the gang life, and street fighting, and focused on what were ultimately peace-building activities, such as philosophy, art, and self-improvement.
This gets to a core idea of why we tend to admire people: those who have power but don't abuse it.
Any schmoe can be peaceful, but it's different when someone turns from violence to peace, especially when they're still capable of violence, and a warrior at heart.

A possible commonality between philosophy and combat is essentialism. A street fight gets to some core aspects of human, and even animal, nature. If you continually click the first link on Wikipedia, you'll eventually end up on the page for philosophy, no matter where you start. See this for a fascinating explanation of the Wikipedia link rule: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-llumS2rA8I)

There is a photo of Bruce Lee in his casket that has really stayed with me (https://i0.wp.com/.../2015/11/Brucelee11-Khurki.net_.jpg...). All of that ambition and discipline and drive and talent and energy and good character were simply gone, without reason.

I once heard an interview where the person, speaking of mind uploading, said that in the future we'll look back at the current era with astonishment. The era in which we carried around something as precious as our entire mind in this biological vessel - subject to innumerable, and sometimes unexpected, risks of complete loss. We do better with our hard drives.

Nonexistence is perhaps especially incongruous and inexplicable when someone young dies so suddenly. Even more so when they're a great person, like Bruce Lee. Oumou Sangare has a song title that captures this well: [Saa Magna - "Death is Terrible"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_YyroDeZrY).

Perhaps a takeaway from Bruce Lee's life is that, rather than focus on the tragedy of his early death, one can focus instead on how thoughtful, deep, and self-disciplined he was, to be able to identify, and to profoundly fulfill, such essential aspects of life within such a short time.
