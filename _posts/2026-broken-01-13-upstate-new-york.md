There's a worldwide workshare program called WWOOF: Willing Workers on Organic Farms.
The program connects workers with farms, and the deal is that the workers work half days (around 20 hours a week) in exchange for housing and food, but no salary/payment.

In the summer and early fall of 2012, I was doing WWOOF workshares at various farms in New England.
The last workshare I did was at a farm in upstate New York.
The couple hosting the workshare were the absolute nicest people in the world.
Both were retired, and their children had grown up and moved out of the home years ago.
They had a huge home which literally looked like a castle.
Their home was beautiful, inside and out, as was their entire estate.

And that was my experience in upstate New York!
