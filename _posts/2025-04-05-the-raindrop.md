### The Raindrop

<div style="text-align: center">
<br/>
<i>The first poem I wrote in sixth grade English class, when I was 10 years old<br/>
<br/><br/>

<b style="font-size: 20px;">The raindrop</b><br/>

If I were a raindrop<br/>
I would slowly fall to the ground below<br/>
Smoothly I would slowly fall with other raindrops<br/>
We would merge and be symbions<br/>
again the raindrop dissolves and is reborn<br/>
A fresh sent would hang suspended in the air<br/>
The raindrop never dies.<br/><br/>
