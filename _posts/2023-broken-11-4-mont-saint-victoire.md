Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley, by Paul Cézanne¹
</span>
<br>

<hr/>

<p>
In college in 2009, I wrote two poems in "response" to a painting within a series of paintings by Paul Cézanne.
The series of paintings is called "Mont Sainte-Victoire".
The name of the class was "The Writing of Poetry".
</p>

<p>
I can't remember which painting in the series I was looking at when thinking of the poem, but all the paintings in the series are similar.

<i>First poem:</i><br/>

I wake up this morning<br/>
drawn to my easel,<br/>
the edges of a dream<br/>
still circulating<br/>

I hunch over, blinking<br/>
before choosing colors<br/>
Lining up the tubes:<br/>
yellow, orange, milky blue<br/>

Drawing my bathrobe<br/>
together at the collar,<br/>
I pause, agaze through the soft-lit window<br/>
Lost in the warm sun<br/>

This looking out the window<br/>
seems to last an eternity<br/>
And when I return, no longer floating<br/>
I am again Paul: again a painter<br/>

<hr/>

<i>Second poem:</i><br/>

A freshly woken mind<br/>
from a midday nap projected<br/>
onto the ill-defined edges,<br/>
the windy country roads and spacious<br/>
fields between the homesteads<br/>

white cloud and blue mountain<br/>
float in muted synchrony<br/>
beyond the sunshine hamlet<br/>
and its aquaduct<br/>
