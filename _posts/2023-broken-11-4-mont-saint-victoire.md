I wrote this poem in 2009 for a poetry class in college.
The name of the class was "The Writing of Poetry".

Looks like it was in "response" to a Cezanne painting within his series called "Mont Sainte-Victoire".


A freshly woken mind
from a midday nap projected
onto the ill-defined edges,
the windy country roads and spacious
fields between the homesteads

white cloud and blue mountain
float in muted synchrony
beyond the sunshine hamlet
and its aquaduct
