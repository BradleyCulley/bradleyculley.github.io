    On the last day of summer break before my junior year of college, in 2009, I took an 11-hour road trip from my hometown of Mercer, Maine to Leverett, Massachusetts.
    What was in Leverett, Massachusetts?
    The New England Peace Pagoda, a Buddhist shrine. 
</p>

<p>
    The building of the pagoda was organized by Nipponzan-Myōhōji-Daisanga, a Buddhism-adjacent Japanese religious organization founded in 1917¹.
    Here it is³:

<p>
Nipponzan-Myōhōji-Daisanga is a highly peace-oriented group.
"...[Nipponzan-Myōhōji-Daisanga] is actively engaged worldwide in the peace movement. It is the most pacifist group in Japan of seven religious movements surveyed by Robert Kisala."¹
</p>

<p>
"The most recognizable achievement of Nipponzan-Myōhōji is peace pagodas (stupas), that have been erected in various locations around the world, the first of which was inaugurated in 1954 at Kumamoto in Japan. Since then cities such as London, New Delhi, Vienna, Comiso (in Italy) and Tokyo have all received peace pagodas."¹

"Most, though not all, peace pagodas built since World War II have been built under the guidance of Nichidatsu Fujii (1885–1985), a Buddhist monk from Japan and founder of the Nipponzan-Myōhōji Buddhist Order."²

"In 1947, [Nichidatsu Fujii] began constructing Peace Pagodas as shrines to world peace"²
</p>

<p>
"In 1985 the first peace pagoda in the United States was completed, the New England Peace Pagoda in Leverett, Massachusetts."

I drove 6.5 hours to Leverett, without stopping, spent perhaps 30 minutes or so at the site of the shrine, and then drove back home.
</p>

<p>
Around 9 months later, I visited another of the Peace Pagodas - this time in Pokhara, Nepal, while studying abroad in Nepal.
The one in Pokhara is at the top of a small mountain overlooking a lake.

People have been making pilgrimages, in one form or another, for thousands of years.
A pilgrimage need to necessarily be directly religious in nature, either.
It could be something like the Grand Canyon, the Eiffel Tower, or the birthplace of one of one's heros in life.
I've noticed, also, that they're often specifically pilgrimages on foot: walking to, or towards, a holy land of some kind.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
All humans were at one time persistence hunters.
We would chase animals like Gazelles for extended periods of time, as a group, on foot, at a jogging pace, until the animal got exhausted.
I once heard that typical total distances for the chase - until the animal got exhausted - were about 10 kilometers. 
</p>

<p>
I once read the opinion that it's no coincidence that modern humans get together and run road races as a group.
Typical road race distances are about 5-10 kilometers, usually at a jogging pace.
</p>

<p>
A human need for pilgrimages, in some form or another, might be similar.
</p>

<p>
Below is a poem I wrote about the shrine and the surrounding area.
The poem wasn't for a class or a project or anything...just felt like writing it.
</p>

<p>
The word "circumambulation", used in the poem, means walking around the shrine in a circular pattern.
Circumambulation is a traditional way in which a religious devotee interacts with a temple or shrine.

<b style="font-size: 20px;">Leverett</b><br/><br/>

Winding roads, roads that seem to slow the shrubs<br/>
that grow beside the trees<br/>
and bend quietly the gait of children<br/>
who wander in the shade.<br/>
And give that shade to mailboxes,<br/>
which lie beneath the boughs that spring upward-<br/>
from the dust of their gravel shore.<br/>

And you, great shrine,<br/>
hardly there amidst the pines,<br/>
with hardly a glance to support<br/>
your so worthy intentions.<br/>
Or circumambulations to show how irrevocable<br/>
is the nobility of your shining<br/>
beneath the trees.<br/>
