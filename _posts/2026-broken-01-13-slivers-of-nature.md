<b>My father used to say places like the sliver of forest at the edge of a parking lot are somehow more wild than even deep nature.</b>

<p>
From mid-2018 to early 2020, I lived in Northeastern Virginia.
A nice thing about Northeastern Virginia is the miniature parks one finds sprinkled throughout its suburban neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
One day, I chanced across a video of a person walking in a park in the rain, and the park randomly turned out to be right nearby.
The park is Pimmit View Park in Falls Church, Virginia, and this is the video (click to watch it in a new tab):<br/>

</a>

It's quite a pleasant film.
</p>

<p>
I walked the circuit just like in the video.
Part the magic was that, as you can see in the video, there are homes all around the park.
It was like a backyard tree fort: near to people, yet in another world.
</p>

<p>
I think a lot of people have a sort of sanctuary like this: perhaps the park where they eat breakfast on Saturday mornings, or their garden at home.
</p>

<p>
Another time, I walked through one of those Virginia mini-parks with my father.
Looking back, it's perhaps no accident, but rather shared inclination, that that's what we did, rather than, say, going to a museum.

<p>
A few years before living in Virginia, I lived and worked in the Binghamton, New York area.
At a certain point, I found this park — "Choconut Center Park": <a href="https://www.mypacer.com/parks/147331/choconut-center-park-binghamton" target="_blank">link</a>
</p>

<p>
This is the entrance:
---todo add a photo of the entrance to the park--
The surroundings are everyday rural Americana: two-lane highways on two sides, an industrial park on another side, and fire station across the street.   
The everyday surroundings somehow facilitated the feeling of transcendence to the place.
TODO: add photo of the entrance of the park.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
I found a small path from the park's main road to a stream just below. 
The stream was fairly hidden from the two roads that sandwich it: the highway on one side and the main road in the park on the other:
TODO: add a drawn diagram showing the layout
</p>

<p>
At the stream, I'd sometimes sit in a sort of natural seat formed by the roots of a tree on the streambank.
I took this photo from that seat or right nearby:<br/>

<br/>
I think the branches running across the photo are the branches of that tree.
</p>

<p>
The streambed was mesmerizing; the elegance of the rocks and the water.<br/>

It was a world of fractals: stones, leaves, patterns in the water.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
The contrast of that stream to its unremarkable surroundings is perhaps typical for a sliver of nature.
The surroundings are the wrapping, and in the contrast lies half the magic.
