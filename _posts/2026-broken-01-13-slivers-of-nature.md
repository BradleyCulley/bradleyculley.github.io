<b>My father used to say that places like the sliver of forest at the edge of a parking lot are somehow more wild than even deep nature.</b>

<p>
From mid-2018 to early 2020, I lived in Northeastern Virginia.
A nice thing about Northeastern Virginia is the miniature parks one finds sprinkled throughout its suburban neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
One day, I chanced across a video of a person walking in a park in the rain.
Randomly, the park was close to where I lived. It's Pimmit View Park in Falls Church, Virginia.
This is the video (click to watch it in a new tab):<br/>

</a>

Quite a pleasant film.
</p>

<p>
I walked the walking path circuit just like in the video.
Part the magic was that, as you can see in the video, there are homes all around the park.
It was like a backyard tree fort: near to people, yet in another world.
</p>

<p>
I think a lot of people have a sort of sanctuary like this: perhaps the park where they eat breakfast on Saturdays, or their garden at home.
</p>

<p>
Another time, I walked through one of those Virginia mini-parks with my father.
Looking back, it's perhaps no accident, but rather shared inclination, that that's what we did — rather than, say, going to a museum.

<p>
A while before living in Virginia, I lived in the Binghamton, New York area.
At a certain point, I found this park — "Choconut Center Park": <a href="https://www.mypacer.com/parks/147331/choconut-center-park-binghamton" target="_blank">link</a>.
</p>

<p>
The park's surroundings are typical rural Americana: two-lane highways on two sides, an industrial park on another side, and a fire station across the street.
This is the layout:<br/> TODO - add the fire station, and maybe the internal road, to the diagram.

</p>

<hr/>

<p>
I found a small path from the park's main road to a creek, named Little Choconut Creek, just below. 
The creek was fairly hidden from the roads on either side: the highway on one side and the main road in the park on the other.
</p>

<p>
At the creek, I'd sometimes sit in a natural seat formed by the roots of a tree.
I took this photo from that seat or right nearby:<br/>

<br/>
I think the branches in the foreground are the branches of the tree.
</p>

<p>
The creekbed was mesmerizing; the elegance of the rocks and the water.<br/>

It was a world of fractals: stones, leaves, patterns in the water.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
The contrast of the elegance of the creek with its everyday surroundings is perhaps characteristic of a sliver of nature.
The surroundings are the wrapping, and in the contrast lies half the magic.
