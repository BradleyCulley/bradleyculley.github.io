### How Lovely Wetness Makes the Flesh

<p>
    In the summer of 2009, I read the poem "How Lovely Wetness Makes the Flesh"¹ by the famous American playwright and screenwriter Tennessee Williams².
</p>

<p>
    I chanced upon the poem in a paper copy of Harper's Magazine.
    There was an editor's note below the poem that was very much part of the experience, too.
</p>

<p>
    Reading the poem and the note created a distinctive sort of positive reaction in my mind. It's my favorite poem of all time.
</p>

<p>
    The reaction it created reminds me of something from a short film titled "Why Details Matter," by the video artist Van Neistat³.
</p>

<p>
    In the film, Neistat talks about his tendency to fixate on details: using exactly the right brand of pencil, the temperature of his art studio, and so on.
    I wasn't fixated on details, but I resonated with the resolution he describes.
</p>

<p>
    Anyway, concerned about his tendency to fixate on details, Neistat seeks the opinion of his romantic partner:³
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, this spirited man sought counsel and reconciliation from a spirited woman, from his domestic partner, baby mama, main squeeze, common law wife — a spirited woman who's tasked with pulling the slack when <i>he's</i> succumbed to this detail or that.</p>
<p>"These details matter to me to such an extent," he explained, "that I'm willing to endure any consequences as a result of having committed to these ridiculous details, and it feels like I can't help it."</p>
<p>And her reply — offhanded, and gentle, and light, and truthful — ignited within this spirited man an epiphany: a moment of sudden revelation or insight.</p>
<p>And what the spirited woman — this spirited man's domestic partner, baby mama, main squeeze, common law wife — said was this: she said simply, "I love that about you."</p>
</blockquote>
