MLBWYA, the title of this blog, stands for "May Love Be With You Always"
</p>

<p>
A friend of my father sent me a card when I graduated from college.
He wrote a nice message in the body of the card, and on the signature line wrote "May love be with you always", and then his name.
This is the front of the card he chose - beautiful design:
**TODO add a photo of the front of the card**
</p>

<p>
The phrase burrowed deeply into my mind.
It seems as good a summary as possible of really matters in life, and so I've made it the title of this blog.
