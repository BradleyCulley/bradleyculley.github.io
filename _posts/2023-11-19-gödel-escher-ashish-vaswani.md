I think the continued development of artificial intelligence will lead to a bit of an epistemic unraveling of teleological claims. There's been some of that already.

A few years ago, I read a news article along these lines:

“Every year, a team wins the Super Bowl. That then begs the question: what's the point of winning the Super Bowl?".

If a machine can do everything a human can do, what's the purpose of a human doing something? This is particularly important for domains previously considered the sole purview of humans. Work and relationships are under siege.

If not technē, is hedonia teleological? What about eudaimonia?

Qualia in general? Specific qualia, such as raising children?

What if an AI can raise children according to a specification?

Are those things teleological when a machine can replicate them, down through neuromorphic signal transduction?

It would be interesting if AI drove a renaissance in epistemology, teleology, and logos.

I think solutions will, as with the Super Bowl, be deontological. That's because consequentialist approaches will be as good as gone.
