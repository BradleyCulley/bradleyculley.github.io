"Food chains are often used in ecological modeling (such as a three-species food chain). They are simplified abstractions of real food webs..." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_chain

I think this is also why we tend to have cults in America. Mormons, Amish, liberals, conservatives etc.
This also I think feeds into the fenced off compound idea, that kind of lives in an ethereal plane in the American imagination.

Add to the food web essay or over individualism essay the phenomenon of seen on occasion of the extremely pious squared away well behaved almost unsettlingly well behaved child. The parent kind of both puts them in a bubble and heavily guides them in a direction of sort of almost caricature-esque levels of good behavior. When I see that I tend to think "That bubble will burst". I think it would be much preferable to guide the child in the direction of generally good behavior but also but also infuse them more with the real world.
