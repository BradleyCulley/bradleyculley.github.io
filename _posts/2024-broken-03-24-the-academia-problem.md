email thread with Ben Brooks in which I discuss these things:  https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/physics+job+ben+brooks/FMfcgxmQJRTMbgRDxbqClXLXHJKFSsfk

Part of the academia problem is a perspective of a certain kind of stasis. 
The stone buildings, the titles, the years-long slow walk to tenure with it's shibbolethic rituals and political power games.  
The hierarchies, the academic calendar - each year structured the same as the last, the majors, the courses (basic calculus has been the same material for hundreds of years), 
the grade levels (e.g kindergarten through 12th grade) then the year levels (freshman, sophomore..."L1" for first-year law student). 

This was particularly true pre-computers, and even moreso pre-AI.

Paradoxically, it's the sector of society that generates a lot of the new ideas, but it itself has a certain timelessness.

For example, it's not uncommon for a company to increase 10x in head count in five years, but it is extremely uncommon, or perhaps has never even happened, that an academic department in mathematics increased 10x in headcount, even over like 100 years. 

I think begets a certain way of looking at resource planning, politics, and really a lot of things. In particular is the idea of the production and resources versus the distribution of resources. I think part of the reason academics are so focused on the distribution of resources is that they live in a world in which the quantity of resources seems fixed.

I think it's also part of why such batshit crazy leftist utopian Marxist economic and political ideas come out of academia; especially out of humanities departments.
The Frankfurt school is a prime example. 

I don't think ignoring the distribution of resources is the right move either, though.

The sweet spot is probably something like 65%/35%, and a place like Denmark gets it more or less right.

Go back a thousand years and the question is whether the *focus* should be on be taking a flagon of beer, or a gold dabloon, away from this person and giving it to this person, or maybe give a little love to things like factories and discovering electricity.

When I talk to Americans liberals about Europe, they sometimes say, "Europe is nice because it's socialist".
Fun fact: Europe is not socialist, it's capitalist.
The president of Denmark once had to go on TV and personally clear this up, stating,

The production of resources is the clear winner it's not so simple I'm sure the graph of time for example because you can have societies like the United States that have unbelievably large levels of production of resources but to pitiful distribution of resources to the absolute poorest people in need. 

Is a balance somewhere perhaps 70-30 or something like that or 65-35 of distribution and production, with production being more important.
