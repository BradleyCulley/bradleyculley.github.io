### The Mirror

<p>
    The Andersons lived on a 15-acre plot of land, not quite in the countryside and not quite in the city.
    In their town, each home stood on a sizeable plot of land, with a long tree-lined driveway.
    A well-mannered peacefulness reigned throughout.
</p>

<p>
    The Anderson residence was both homely and stately: ivy-covered stucco tan exteriors, ivy flowing down the wall, and arched doorways with thick cherry-wood doors.
    The children, Sarah and Evan, had both grown up in the home.
    Sarah was 21, a rising senior at a well-known college in another state, majoring in chemistry with plans to become a doctor.
    Evan was 26 and worked in marketing. He'd studied economics in college, also at a well-known college.
</p>

<p>
    Growing up, there was a particular family ritual specific to the home.
    When their mother and father, Edward and Barbara, bought the home, the realtor had showed them a special feature: a reflecting mirror in the back yard, a spyglass built into the wall, and an old wooden chair inside one of the hallways.
    The mirror, which is roughly the shape of the head of a spoon, sits atop a burnished silver pole.
    The pole pokes up from the lush green of the back lawn rather like a street lamp.
</p>

<p>
    The mirror, atop the pole, stands about 3 feet above the grass and is about 20 feet from the stuccoed wall of the back of the home.
    Twice a year, at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, the sun is positioned in the sky such that its rays strike the center of mirror.
    When that happens, the mirror focuses those rays into a spyglass that's embedded into the back wall of the home.
</p>

<p>
    The spyglass is about 3 inches in diameter, about 10 inches long, and sits about 3 feet up from the ground.
    The spyglass is built right into the wall, so that one end is flush with the outside surface of the wall, and the other flush with the inside surface of the wall.
    The wall containing the spyglass is the back wall of the hallway between the dining room and the foyer.
</p>

<p>
    In that hallway, across from the wall in which the spyglass is embedded, there sits a brown wooden chair with faded dowels forming the back supports, and pleasantly worn armrests.
    On the day of a given equinox, a family members sits in the chair, sunlight strikes the mirror, streams through the spyglass, and lands just about in the center of the person's chest.
    The family tradition was that if you sit in the chair, with the beam of light on you, you can ask yourself - quietly in your mind - one question, to which you'll receive a completely honest answer.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, nobody in the family believed in the supernatural.
    That being said, they reasoned that the ritual of the mirror and the light helped them focus somehow: to let quieter thoughts flow, perhaps.
</p>

<p>
    That summer, the parents had sold the home, in order to downsize to a smaller home, since both children were off in college and launched into the world.
    The autumnal equinox that year happened to be during a school break, a few weeks before the home was set to close and the family was set to move.
    On the day of the equinox, everyone was busy packing, cooking, and socializing.
</p>

<p>
    A few minutes before the equinox, the son Evan started looking among the cardboard boxes in the foyer until he found the wooden chair.
    He lifted it from the box, pulled away the packing material, and took it to the hallway.
    In the hallway, he set the chair against the wall - across from the spyglass - and sat down, waiting for the light to appear.
</p>

<p>
    After a minute or so, the light began to beam through the spyglass, striking the center of his chest.
    He sat still and upright, his mind entirely quiet.
    With closed eyes, he asked himself a question: "Why is my friend Henry generally nice to me, but every so often injects some small but piercing criticism of me?"
</p>

<p>
    After a moment, Evan heard the voice in his mind, as though speaking from the center of his chest: "He hates you."
</p>

<p>
    The voice was always clear yet quiet, like the rippling of a wave across a lake in the rain.
</p>

<p>
    After some time, Evan rose from the chair and walked outside to where the mirror stood.
    He crouched down in front of the mirror and peered at it intently - something he'd never done before.
</p>

<p>
    The intricacies of the golden-braided pattern of the mirror's frame looked like the burls on an oak tree.
    As the sun continued upward in the sky, and so downward in the mirror, he noticed something near the bottom of the dull gray reflective portion of the mirror.
    It was writing, etched in a neatly flowing golden script.
</p>

<p>
    He leaned closer and read the words to himself under his breath.
    It was a quote he'd seen somewhere, but couldn't remember where: "The closer you get to the truth, the simpler it becomes".
</p>
