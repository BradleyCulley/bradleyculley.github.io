Story from the dream, about the mirror in the front yard, the sunlight, the lens in the wall, and the reflecting spot on the wall in the house.
The house was a mix of Hank's house in CT and Ann and Dave's house in Norridgewock, plus some other influences perhaps.
It was a nice house, of wealthy people.

TODO - add the details about the house, the family, their jobs, their ages, their professions, and so on.
TODO: maybe remove some of the details/sentences around her experience
TODO: add that the surface of the mirror curved inward, so that it looked rather like a spoon.

The Andersons lived on a 15-acre plot of land, not quite in the countryside...more like a fancy suburb.
In their suburb, each home stood on a sizeable plot of land, had a long driveway, and usually a pool.
One couldn't see most homes from the road.
Homes sat at the end of tree-lined driveways, surrounded by neatly trimmed lawns.
Privacy, quiet, a good deal of forest, and throughout, a well-mannered peacefulness.

The Anderson residence was at once homely and stately. It had arched doorways, thick wooden doors, made of cherry wood, or something like that.

Sarah and Evan had grown up in the home. Their parents had purchased the home years before they were born.

Sarah was 21, a rising senior at a well-known college, majoring in chemistry, with plans to become a scientist.
Evan was 26 and worked in real estate development. He'd studied economics in college, also at a well-known school.

Growing up, there was a particular family ritual, specific to the family home.

When the mother and father, Edward and Barbara, bought the home, the realtor had shown them a peculiar feature: a reflecting mirror in the back yard, a lens built into the wall, and a chair inside the home.

Twice a year, at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, the sun is in just the right place in the sky such the sun's rays shine perfectly into the center of mirror.
When that happens, the mirror, which is shaped like a spoon, focuses the light into the center of the lens in the wall.
The back wall of the house, in which the lens is embedded, is about 20 feet away from the mirror, across a stretch of lawn.

The lens, which is roughly the size and shape of an old-fashioned spyglass, is about half a foot long and about 3 inches in diameter.

The lens is built right into the wall, such that one end is flush with the outside of the wall, and the other end is flush with the inside of the wall.

This was so that it could focus the sun's rays on the lens in the wall for a full 60 seconds or so.
Also add that when she walked up to the mirror and looked at it, she stood a bit off to the side, so the reflected rays wouldn't get in her eyes.

The light shines perfectly like that once a year.

If you sit in the chair on the beam of light, you can ask yourself one question and you'll receive a completely true answer.
That saying everyone in the family uses is the quote from Thoreau: "I would give all the wealth of the world, and all the deeds of all the heroes, for one true vision." -Henry David Thoreau, Carl Hovde (1980). “A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers”, p.140, Princeton University Press (TODO: validate that source by using Project Gutenberg or similar)

The young daughter sat in the chair and asked it if she'd ever be happy. "Yes".

The son asked it how to make good friends. "Listen more than you speak, be helpful, be loyal, be fun, and be serious".

The father asked it if he'd be remembered years after he died. "No".

The mother asked it for advice about a sick friend. "There's nothing more you can do."

Each heard the voice of the mirror speak in their mind, as though from the center of their chest, right in the middle of their chest bone, both vertically and horizontally.

The voice was always quiet.
It didn't sound like those usual thoughts tugging coursing through one's mind day to day - the thousands of little doubts, gripping urges, and apparent insights.
It was quiet, like the voice of a child when you ask them a simple question.

It was a bit like that voice of a child who hasn't yet felt much of the tougher side of life, and so hasn't developed a protective shell around their true self, in the way they'll look you in the eyes and answer with complete honesty about things - no guile, no sarcasm, no varnish.

This way a child answers, if there was ever an environment to support it, is usually gone by age 8 or 10 at the latest - burnished by the fires of life.

The family is in the process of selling the house.
One day, when the furniture is partly packed and the family is hurriedly preparing to move to their new home, happens to be the day the sun is in just the right part of the sky for the mirror and the chair.

The other family members haven't thought much about the mirror, the light, and the chair for a while, not since the kids were younger.

There was school and work. There were health issues
The youngest, though, the girl, still thought about the mirror, the light, and the chair.

She of course didn't believe in the supernatural, but she reasoned that the ritual of the mirror and the light helped her focus somehow, to let other thoughts go so she could be hear the quieter ones.

So I'm the midst of the hustle of moving, she took the chair out of a moving box, out if its plastic wrap, and set it against the wall in the designated spot.

She sat down, waited for the light to coalesce through the lens, and closed her eyes as it began to illuminate her from her collar bone upward.

She asked one last question, and, as always, almost immediately heard a whispered answer that was quiet, clear, and exact.
As always, it seemed to come from her body rather than her mind - from midway down her chest bone, right from the center of herself, so to speak.

Clear, unambiguous, and, now that she thought of it, it was usually something you already knew, but had just lost track of.

A couple minutes later the sun moved upwards in the sky, and the beam ceased shing through the lens in the wall.
She rose from the chair and walked out to the back garden where the mirror stood.
She was still lost in thought about the question she'd asked, and its incongruously simple answer.

She went up to the mirror, something she'd never done before, looking up at it on the stand in which it sat, about 7 feet up from her feet planed in the neatly trimmed grass.

She'd never really looked closely at the mirror before.
That day through, she moved her eyes all around it, soaking in the details of its design one last time, as though taking a last look at a lover's face.

The silver reflective portion had a dull gray to it. The intricacies of the frame looked like burls on a cherry tree, or an oak.

As the sun up in the sky and so downward in the mirror, she noticed something - now better illuminated - near the bottom edge of the reflective part.
It was writing, etched in plain but neat silver print.
She stood for a few minutes to let the sun finish it's trip past the edge of the frame, the peered closer at the etched words.
She read it or loud to herself, though quietly.
It was a quote she's seen somewhere, but couldn't remember where: "The closer you get to the truth, the simpler it becomes".
