The Andersons lived on a 15-acre plot of land, not quite in the countryside, but not quite in the city.

In their suburb, each home stood on a sizeable plot of land, with a long driveway, and usually with a pool.

Homes were nestled at the end of tree-lined driveways, surrounded by neatly trimmed lawns, and usually visually hidden from the roadway.

A well-mannered peacefulness and decency reigned throughout the town.

The Anderson residence was both homely and stately: ivy-covered stucco tan exteriors, arched doorways, and thick cherry wood doors.

The children, Sarah and Evan, had both grown up in the home.

Sarah was 21, a rising senior at a well-known college, and was majoring in chemistry with plans to become a doctor.

Evan was 26 and worked in marketing. He'd studied economics in college, also at a well-known college.

Growing up, there was a particular family ritual, specific to the home.

When their mother and father, Edward and Barbara, bought the home, the realtor showed them a special feature: a reflecting mirror in the back yard, a spyglass built into the wall, and a chair inside one of the hallways.

The mirror, which is roughly the shape of the head of a spoon, sits atop a burnished silver pole, which pokes up from the lush green of the back lawn like a lamp post.

The mirror, atop the pole, is about 20 feet from the stuccoed back wall of the home, and stands about 7 feet above the grass of the lawn.

Twice a year, at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, the sun is in just the right place in the sky so that the sun's rays shine exactly into the center of mirror.

When that happens, the mirror focuses the sunlight into a spyglass that's embedded into the back wall of the home.

The spyglass is about 10 inches long, about 3 inches in diameter, and sits about 3 feet up from the ground.

It's built right into the wall, so that one end of it is flush with the outside of the wall, and the other end is flush with the inside of the wall.

On the inside of the home, the spyglass is located along one of the long hallways in the home.

In the hallway opposite the spyglass, there's a golden brown wooden chair with wooden dowels forming the back support and pleasantly worn armrests.

On the day of one of the equinoxes, when a family members sits in the chair, sunlight streams into the mirror, through the spyglass, and lands just about in the center of their chest.

The family tradition was that if you sit in the chair, with the beam of light on you, you can ask yourself - quietly in your own mind - one question, to which you'll receive an honest answer.

Of course, nobody in the family believed in the supernatural, but they reasoned that the ritual of the mirror and the light helped them focus somehow; to let quieter thoughts through, perhaps.

That summer, the parents had sold the home, in order to downsize to a smaller home, since both children were off to college and launched into the world.

The autumnal equinox that year happened to be during a school break, a few weeks before the family was set to move out.

On the day of the equinox, everyone was busy packing and going about their business.

There were cardboard boxes in the foyer, and half the silverware was already packed.

The daughter hadn't forgotten the ritual, though.

A few minutes before the ordained time, the looked among the boxes that had been packed until she found that particular wooden chair, removed it from its plastic wrap, and took it to the hallway.

In the hallway, she set the chair down across from the spyglass and sat down, waiting for the light to appear.

After a minute, the light began to beam through the spyglass, and landed on her sternum.

She closed her eyes and asked, quietly to herself, why her friend Rebecca is generally nice, but every so often when they talk seems to inject a small but deep-cutting criticism.

The daughter heard the voice of the mirror speak in her mind, as though from the center of their chest, halfway up the torso and seemingly halfway back from the surface of back chest to her back: "she hates you."

The voice was always quiet, and spoke against a backdrop of a sort of mental hush, like a ripple moving across a lake in the rain.

She sat for a few minutes processing the answer to her question.

After a while, when the sun had moved upward in the sky and the beam had disappeared, she rose from the chair and walked outside to the back garden where the mirror stood, still lost in thought.

She went up close to the mirror, something she'd never done before, looking intently at it upon its stand.

She moved her eyes across every part of it, soaking in the details of its design.

The silver reflective portion had a dull gray to it. The intricacies of the frame looked like the burls on an old oak tree.

As the sun continued upward in the sky, and so downward in the mirror, she noticed something - now better illuminated - near the bottom edge of the dull gray reflective part of the mirror.

It was writing, etched in a plain but neat golden script.

Once the sun's reflection had fully left the bottom edge of the mirror, she leaned closer to make out the words of the script, and read them out loud to herself, under her breath.

It was a quote she's seen somewhere, but couldn't remember where: "The closer you get to the truth, the simpler it becomes".






TODO remove: They didn't forget the ritual though: each family member sat in the chair in succession and asked a question, quietly within their mind.


The son asked how to make good friends. "Listen more than you speak, be helpful, be loyal, be fun, and most of all, be serious."

The mother asked if she'd made the right decision in which career she'd chosen, and how she'd navigated it. "Yes, you've done well."


The father asked if he'd be remembered 100 years after his death. "No".



It wasn't like those usual thoughts wriggling through one's mind day to day - thousands of little doubts, gripping urges, and apparent insights.

It was as clear and direct as the voice of a child when, after you ask them a question, they look you in the eye and answer you with complete honesty.




So I'm the midst of the hustle of moving, she took the chair out of a moving box, out if its plastic wrap, and set it against the wall in the designated spot.

She sat down, waited for the light to coalesce through the lens, and closed her eyes as it began to illuminate her from her collar bone upward.

She asked one last question, and, as always, almost immediately heard a whispered answer that was quiet, clear, and exact.

As always, it seemed to come from her body rather than her mind - from midway down her chest bone, right from the center of herself, so to speak.

Clear, direct, and, now that she thought of it, usually something she already knew, but had just lost track of.








No guile, self-consciousness, sarcasm, or varnish.



Don't use: A child who hasn't yet felt much of the tougher side of life, hasn't developed a protective shell around their true self, in the way they'll look you in the eyes and answer with complete honesty about things - no guile, self-consciousness, no sarcasm, no varnish.

This way a child answers, if there was ever an environment to support it, is usually gone by age 8 or 10 at the latest - burnished by the fires of life.



That saying everyone in the family uses is the quote from Thoreau: "I would give all the wealth of the world, and all the deeds of all the heroes, for one true vision." -Henry David Thoreau, Carl Hovde (1980). “A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers”, p.140, Princeton University Press (TODO: validate that source by using Project Gutenberg or similar)

This was so that it could focus the sun's rays on the lens in the wall for a full 60 seconds or so.
Also add that when she walked up to the mirror and looked at it, she stood a bit off to the side, so the reflected rays wouldn't get in her eyes.

The light shines perfectly like that once a year.


Don't use this: The daughter sat in the chair and asked if she'd ever be happy. "Yes".



Don't use this: The mother asked it for advice about a sick friend. "There's nothing more you can do."



The family is in the process of selling the house.
One day, when the furniture is partly packed and the family is hurriedly preparing to move to their new home, happens to be the day the sun is in just the right part of the sky for the mirror and the chair.

The other family members haven't thought much about the mirror, the light, and the chair for a while, not since the kids were younger.

There was school and work. There were health issues
The youngest, though, the girl, still thought about the mirror, the light, and the chair.

She of course didn't believe in the supernatural, but she reasoned that the ritual of the mirror and the light helped her focus somehow, to let other thoughts go so she could be hear the quieter ones.

So I'm the midst of the hustle of moving, she took the chair out of a moving box, out if its plastic wrap, and set it against the wall in the designated spot.

She sat down, waited for the light to coalesce through the lens, and closed her eyes as it began to illuminate her from her collar bone upward.

She asked one last question, and, as always, almost immediately heard a whispered answer that was quiet, clear, and exact.

As always, it seemed to come from her body rather than her mind - from midway down her chest bone, right from the center of herself, so to speak.

Clear, unambiguous, and, now that she thought of it, it was usually something you already knew, but had just lost track of.

A couple minutes later the sun moved upwards in the sky, and the beam ceased shing through the lens in the wall.
She rose from the chair and walked out to the back garden where the mirror stood.
She was still lost in thought about the question she'd asked, and its incongruously simple answer.

She went up to the mirror, something she'd never done before, looking up at it on the stand in which it sat, about 7 feet up from her feet planed in the neatly trimmed grass.

She'd never really looked closely at the mirror before.
That day through, she moved her eyes all around it, soaking in the details of its design one last time, as though taking a last look at a lover's face.

The silver reflective portion had a dull gray to it. The intricacies of the frame looked like burls on a cherry tree, or an oak.

As the sun up in the sky and so downward in the mirror, she noticed something - now better illuminated - near the bottom edge of the reflective part.
It was writing, etched in plain but neat silver print.
She stood for a few minutes to let the sun finish it's trip past the edge of the frame, the peered closer at the etched words.
She read it or loud to herself, though quietly.
It was a quote she's seen somewhere, but couldn't remember where: "The closer you get to the truth, the simpler it becomes".
