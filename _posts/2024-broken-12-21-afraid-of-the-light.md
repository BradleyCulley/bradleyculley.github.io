Perhaps quote this entire speech by Carl Sagan at the start of the essay, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rmTK6-Ou4A
The clip you've referenced features Carl Sagan walking along the ocean and reflecting on humanity's dreams—both beautiful and troubling. This segment is from the final episode of his 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, titled "Who Speaks for Earth?"

I read a post on X recently, in which the author said he was sick of making children do things against their will every day of their lives
</p>

<p>
After a certain point in the 1600s, candidates for rulers of the Ottoman Empire were confined to house arrest until they ascended to the throne and took power
</p>

<p>
The building to which they were confined was called "Kafes", which simply and literally means "cage" in Turkish
</p>

<p>
Shocking no one, Ottoman rulers came out of the literal cage wildly crazy. An example is Sultan Ibrahim, who ruled from 1640 to 1648, who was known, un-creatively, as "Ibrahim the Mad".
</p>

<p>
Ibrahim the Mad was a sex addict and a wildly dysfunctional ruler. Addiction is, of course, a textbook psychological coping mechanism in response to traumatic life experiences.
</p>

<p>
Among other problems, Ibrahim the Mad's failed leadership led to the Cretan War (1645–1669).
He was eventually executed (by strangling!) at the direction of his mother (!), at the age of 32.
</p>

<p>
As the wise X poster notes, I've noticed it's common practice to make children do things against their will more or less every day of their lives
"Ok yeah but what's the problem with that?, you may say. "After all, kids don't yet know what's good for them".
Well, they don't stay kids forever.
</p>

<p>
Like Ibrahim the Mad, they grow up and take power in the world. It's perhaps no coincidence that the world shaped by adults is so often as crazy as it.
</p>

<p>
The French philosopher Michel Foucault called this "biopower":
"For Foucault, biopower is a technology of power for managing humans in large groups; the distinctive quality of this political technology is that it allows for the control of entire populations."
</p>

<p>
In his 1975 book, "Discipline and Punish", Foucault observed that schools, prisons, barracks, and hospitals all bear an uncanny resemblance to each other.
He termed them all "Disciplinary institutions".
</p>

<p>
In biology there's a maxim that "structure determines function". The function of a school and of a prison have eerily-many similarities, and therefore, perhaps, the "structural" characteristics - and even the physical designs - of the aforementioned institutions follow accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Have you ever noticed how much an American prison looks like more-secured version of an American public high school?
The slate-grey concrete, the dull red, green, and blue pastel walls, the utilitarian windows, the brick exteriors.
***TODO: add a picture of a prison, then below it a picture of a school** 
</p>

<p>
The standard rejoinder here is that schools must have some level of oppressive disciplinary control, in order to shape students into well-functioning adults.
</p>

<p>
But let's make things concrete.
Let's consider the case of the Judge Rotenburg Center in Massachussetts. TODO: fill in the rest here.
This is the video of the young man being tortured while tied down: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcxpGKctZMs.
He was restrained for 7 hours and received 31 separate electric shocks.
A judge ruled that this was acceptable.

<p>
I have a few ripostes - to use a French term - to that.
</p>

Ripostes:<br/>
1. Let's take a one massive step back. Implicit in the above statement about controlling children is the normalization of the assumption of control over another human being. We normalize effective total imperative control over children, often against their will, in a way that we would rebuke for adults. If I decided I was going to commit an innocent random adult to decades of institutionalization against their will, I'd be arrested for kidnapping. The implicit "yeah but..." one can almost hear is the symptom of what Foucault called a "discourse". Like the idea that it's normal you'll get yelled at (and maybe smacked around a little) in military bootcamp, the Foucauldian idea of a "discourse" is that of a normalizing meta-narrative, with an emphasis of power relations. "It's normal for prisoners to work for an average of $0.86/hour". "It's normal for the government to censor political speech". "It's normal to drag your children around on a literal leash". "Normal" doesn't exist in nature. Normal is constructed by human beings, and when it's deeply ingrained enough in a culture, it feel like the air we breathe: we don't even notice it.
2. The anti-natalist argument: what gave you the right to create children at all? That one goes with logos (meaning), telos (purpose, end goals), and so on. Absenting all that, a more directed question would be: would we allow the government to spawn adult prisoners like lab meat, then lock them up from the moment they're created? We permit incarceration as an institution as compensatory for the transgressions of the incarcerated individual, but newborn child has committed no transgressions.
3. The third, more pragmatic, riposte is the Nordic one. Schools in Finland use a "child-centric" approach to learning. Zero standardized testing other than a single test at the end of high school, exploratory learning - with an aim to spark students' curiosity about the world, an emphasis on play, and a foundational emphasis on student well-being. It's perhaps not coincidental that - admittedly to speak with some sweeping generality - Finland, both internally as a society and externally as a nation-state on the geopolitical world stage, has never really done anything crazy. -TODO add citations for the Finnish schools facts

<p>
"For as children tremble and fear everything in the blind darkness, so we in the light sometimes fear what is no more to be feared than the things that children in the dark hold in terror and imagine will come true"
-Lucretius, from the poem "De Rerum Natura"
</p>

Add to the afraid of the light essay the prison stuff. The main prison with the guy being sprayed maybe. The Georgia prisons with a violation of their constitutional rights. The wing correctional essay and mother Jones and or it talks about the sexual slaves there. And tie it back to recidivism. You expect someone to endure these conditions and come out a well-functioning will adjusted member of society. That's a bit much.
