I read a post on X recently, in which the author stated he was sick of making children do things against their will every day of their lives

After a certain point in the 1600s, candidates for rulers of the Ottoman Empire were confined to house arrest until they ascended to the throne and took power

The building to which they were confined was called "Kafes", which simply and literally means "cage" in Turkish

Shocking to no one, Ottoman rulers came out of the literal cage batshit crazy. For example, Sultan Ibrahim, who ruled from 1640 to 1648, and was known as "Ibrahim the Mad".

Ibrahim the Mad was a sex addict and a dysfunctional ruler. Addiction is of course a textbook psychological reaction to traumatic life experiences.

Among other problems, Ibrahim the Mad's failed leadership led to the Cretan War (1645â€“1669). He was eventually executed (by strangling!) at the direction of his mother, at the age of 32.

I've noticed it's common practice to make children do things against their will more or less every day of their lives

Children then grow up and take power in the world. It's perhaps no coincidence that the world shaped by adults is as screwed up as it.

The French philosopher Michel Foucault called this "biopower":
"For Foucault, biopower is a technology of power for managing humans in large groups; the distinctive quality of this political technology is that it allows for the control of entire populations."

In his 1975 book, "Discipline and Punish", Foucault observed that schools, prisons, barracks, and hospitals all bear an uncanny resemblance to each other. He termed them all "Disciplinary institutions".

In biology there's a maxim that "structure determines function". The function of a school and of a prison have eerily-many similarities, and therefore, perhaps, the characteristics of these institutions follow accordingly.

The standard rejoiner here is that schools must have some level of oppressive disciplinary control, otherwise how would we be able to shape students into adults?

I think there are a few ripostes (to use a French term) to that. One is that implicit in that statement is the assumption of control over another human being. We normalize imperative total control over children in a way that we would rebuke for adults. If I decided I was going to commit an innocent random adult to decades of institutionalization against their will, I'd be arrested for kidnapping.

This is what Foucault, relatedly, called a "discourse". Like the idea that it's normal that's you'll get yelled at (and maybe smacked around a little) in military bootcamp, the Foucauldian idea of a "discourse" is that of a normalizing meta-narrative, with an emphasis of power relations.

"It's normal for prisoners to work for an average of $0.86/hour". "It's normal for the government to censor political speech". "It's normal to drag your children around on a literal leash". And so on.

The second riposte would be the anti-natalist argument: what gave you the right to create children at all? That one goes deep in terms of logos, telos, and so on. Absenting all that, a more directed question would be: would we allow the government to spawn prisoners like lab meat, only to lock them up from the moment they're born? We permit incarceration as an institution as compensatory for the transgressions of the incarcerated individual, but a newborn child has committed no such transgressions.

The third, more pragmatic, riposte is the Nordic one. Schools in Finland use a "child-centric" approach to learning. Zero standardized testing other than a single test at the end of high school, exploratory learning - with an aim to spark students' curiosity about the world, an emphasis on play, and a foundational emphasis on student well-being.

"For as children tremble and fear everything in the blind darkness, so we in the light sometimes fear what is no more to be feared than the things that children in the dark hold in terror and imagine will come true"
-Lucretius, from the poem "De Rerum Natura"
