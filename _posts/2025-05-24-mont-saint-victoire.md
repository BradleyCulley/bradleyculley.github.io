<i>Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley</i>, by Paul Cézanne¹
</div>
<br>

<hr/>

<p>
In a college class in 2009, I wrote two poems in "response" to a painting within a series of paintings by Paul Cézanne.
The series is titled "Mont Sainte-Victoire". Mont Sainte-Victoire is a mountain ridge in the south of France.²
The name of the college class was "The Writing of Poetry".
</p>

<p>
Below are the poems, with slight updates.
I can't remember which painting in the series I was looking at when writing the poems. It may have been the one pictured above. All the paintings in the series are of the same landscape with the mountain ridge.

<i>First poem:</i><br/>

I wake up this morning<br/>
drawn to my easel,<br/>
the edges of a dream<br/>
still circulating<br/>

I hunch over, blinking<br/>
before choosing colors<br/>
Lining up the tubes:<br/>
yellow, orange, milky blue<br/>

Drawing my bathrobe<br/>
together at the collar,<br/>
I pause, agaze through the soft-lit window<br/>
Lost in the warm sun<br/>

This looking out the window<br/>
seems to last an eternity<br/>
And when I return, no longer floating<br/>
I am again Paul: again a painter<br/>

<hr/>

<i>Second poem:</i><br/>

A freshly woken mind<br/>
from a midday nap projected<br/>
onto the ill-defined edges,<br/>
the windy country roads,
and spacious fields between the homesteads<br/>

White cloud and blue mountain<br/>
float in muted synchrony<br/>
beyond the sunshine hamlet<br/>
and its aqueduct<br/>
