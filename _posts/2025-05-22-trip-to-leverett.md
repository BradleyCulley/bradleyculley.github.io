## <div align="center">Trip to Leverett</div>

<p>
    In 2009, on the last day of summer break before my junior year of college, I took a road trip from Maine to Leverett, Massachusetts, and back.
</p>

<p>
    What's in Leverett, Massachusetts?
    The New England Peace Pagoda, a Buddhist shrine.
</p>

<p>
    The creation of the pagoda was organized by Nipponzan-Myōhōji-Daisanga, a Buddhism-adjacent Japanese religious organization founded in 1917¹.
    This is a photo of the pagoda²:

</p>

<p>
"...[Nipponzan-Myōhōji-Daisanga] is actively engaged worldwide in the peace movement. It is the most pacifist group in Japan of seven religious movements surveyed by Robert Kisala."¹
</p>

<p>
"The most recognizable achievement of Nipponzan-Myōhōji is peace pagodas (stupas), that have been erected in various locations around the world, the first of which was inaugurated in 1954 at Kumamoto in Japan. Since then cities such as London, New Delhi, Vienna, Comiso (in Italy) and Tokyo have all received peace pagodas."¹

"Most, though not all, peace pagodas built since World War II have been built under the guidance of Nichidatsu Fujii (1885–1985), a Buddhist monk from Japan and founder of the Nipponzan-Myōhōji Buddhist Order."³

"In 1947, [Nichidatsu Fujii] began constructing Peace Pagodas as shrines to world peace."³
</p>

<p>
"In 1985 the first peace pagoda in the United States was completed, the New England Peace Pagoda in Leverett, Massachusetts."
</p>

<p>
On that day in 2009, I drove to Leverett, spent maybe 30 minutes at the site of the pagoda, then drove home. About 11 hours round-trip.

<p>
People have been making pilgrimages for thousands of years.
A pilgrimage need not be religious. It could be to the Grand Canyon or the Eiffel Tower.
I've noticed, as well, that pilgrimages are often on foot: walking to a holy land of some kind.
</p>

<p>
Earlier that same summer, on the way home from a different pilgrimage of sorts — to coastal Maine and back — I was talking to my father on the phone.
He told me Jack Kerouac used to feel somehow "wiped clean", so to speak, after his travels.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
At one time, all humans were persistence hunters.
We would chase animals for extended periods of time, as a group, on foot, at a jogging pace, until the animal got exhausted.
I've heard that typical distances for the chase were about 10 kilometers. 
</p>

<p>
I've read the opinion that it's no coincidence that, these days, humans get together and run road races as a group.
Typical road race distances are about 5-10 kilometers, usually at a jogging pace.
</p>

<p>
A human need for pilgrimages might be similar.

<p>
Below is a poem I wrote about the World Peace Pagoda in Leverett and the surrounding area.
The poem wasn't for a class or a project or anything...just felt like writing it.
</p>

<p>
The word "circumambulation" in the poem means "walking around the shrine in a circular pattern".
Circumambulation is a traditional way in which a person interacts with a shrine.

<b style="font-size: 20px;">Leverett</b><br/><br/>

Winding roads, roads that seem to slow the shrubs<br/>
that grow beside the trees<br/>
and bend quietly the gait of children<br/>
who wander in the shade.<br/>
And give that shade to mailboxes,<br/>
which lie beneath the boughs that spring upward<br/>
from the dust of their gravel shore.<br/><br/>

And you, great pagoda,<br/>
hardly there amidst the pines,<br/>
with hardly a glance to support<br/>
your so worthy intentions.<br/>
Or circumambulations to show how irrevocable<br/>
is the nobility of your shining<br/>
beneath the trees.
