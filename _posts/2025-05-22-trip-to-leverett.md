## <div align="center">Trip to Leverett</div>

<p>
    In 2009, on the last day of summer break before my junior year of college, I took a road trip from my home town in central Maine to Leverett, Massachusetts, and back.
</p>

<p>
    What's in Leverett, Massachusetts?
    The New England Peace Pagoda, a Buddhist shrine.
</p>

<p>
    The creation of the pagoda was organized by Nipponzan-Myōhōji-Daisanga, a Buddhist-adjacent Japanese religious organization founded in 1917¹.
    This is the pagoda - it's the structure on the right-hand side of the photo²:

    </div>
</p>

<p>
There are peace pagodas all over the world, including in London, New Delhi, and Vienna.¹
They're intended to promote world peace.³
The one in Leverett was the first built in the United States, in 1985.¹
</p>

<p>
I drove to Leverett, spent maybe 30 minutes at the pagoda and the grounds around it, then drove home. The round trip was about 11 hours.
</p>

<p>
People have been making pilgrimages for thousands of years.
A pilgrimage can be secular, too: the Grand Canyon or the Eiffel Tower.
</p>

<p>
Earlier that summer, on the way home from a different pilgrimage of sorts — to coastal Maine and back — I was talking to my father on the phone.
He told me Jack Kerouac used to feel somehow "wiped clean" after his travels.
</p>

<p>
Below is an updated version of a poem I wrote — I think shortly after the trip — about the area around the pagoda, and the pagoda itself.
The poem wasn't for a class or anything: I just felt like writing it.
</p>

<p>
The word "circumambulation" in the poem means "walking around a shrine in a circular pattern".
Circumambulation is a traditional way in which a person interacts with a shrine.

<br/><br/>
<b style="font-size: 20px;">Leverett</b><br/><br/>

Winding roads, roads that seem to slow the shrubs<br/>
that grow beside the trees<br/>
and bend quietly the gait of children<br/>
who wander in the shade.<br/>
And give that shade to mailboxes,<br/>
which lie beneath the boughs that spring upward<br/>
from the dust of their gravel shore.<br/><br/>

And you, great pagoda,<br/>
hardly there amidst the pines,<br/>
with hardly a glance to support<br/>
your so worthy intentions.<br/>
Or circumambulations to show how irrevocable<br/>
is the nobility of your shining<br/>
beneath the trees.
