<p>
A few years ago, I spent some time living near the ocean in Hampton, New Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
It's perhaps not well known that there's oceanfront in New Hampshire. There isn't much: a little strip of coastline.

</p>

<p>
Hampton is one of the towns on that coastline.
Both condos I lived in in Hampton were right off a road that ran alongside the ocean.
The road is called Ocean Boulevard.
</p>

<p>
One of the condos was less than a 60-second walk to a sidewalk along the seawall above the beach.
This shows the sidewalk, the seawall, and Ocean Boulevard:

</p>

<p>
I also spent time in another condo on Ocean Boulevard, just down the road. That one had an oceanfront view.
A sliding glass door opened to a balcony overlooking the ocean:

</p>

<p>
I worked from a desk off the left-hand side of that photo.
Sometimes I'd leave the curtains open to be able to look out over the waves every now and then.
</p>

<p>
The beach near the condos:

</div>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Everything about each condo was pleasant: the landlord, the condo itself, and the ocean nearby.
</p>


<hr/>

<p>
I went for walks, usually at night, along the sidewalk by the seawall.
Waves rolled in from the horizon, each breaking with a muted sigh.
</p>

<p>
The town was quiet at night. Not many people on the sidewalk. Rhythmic crashing of the waves.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I'd walk right on the beach - on the sand itself, rather than on the sidewalk up above.
</p>

<p>
On one walk, I crossed an area rather like this, stepping on high spots so my feet didn't get wet:

</div>
</p>

<p>
This is the edge of the water:

</div>
</p>

<p>
Something I noticed was how soothing the sound of the waves is.
I understood better why people pay a premium for oceanfront properties.
It was like a jetpack of calm.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
I once read a description, written by an introvert, of a day in the life of an introvert.
I can't remember the exact words, but he said something like that he didn't so much read a book as become emotionally engulfed in a book, lost in a book.
</p>

<p>
That's how I felt in Hampton.
More than a passing enjoyment, I felt somehow engulfed; happily lost in the experience of the ocean.
