### Ant



<div style="text-align: center">
<i>A poem I wrote in my final semester of high school</i><br/><br/>
<b style="font-size: 16px;">Ant</b><br/><br/>
             An<br/>
       ant trips over<br/>      
   pieces of dust, stumbles<br/>
its way to an ant hole, carries<br/>
  big leaves on its back, goes<br/>
      down into darkness<br/>
         fearlessly,<br/>
            she<br/>
   crawls on vertical walls,<br/>
  headed straight to the queen,<br/>
 bequeathing her strenuous load<br/>
  she is touched by strangers’s<br/>
     antennae as she makes<br/>
        her way down,<br/>
          looking<br/>
            up<br/>
           only<br/>
         once, she<br/>
       arrives at the<br/>
    single fertile sister<br/>
     she envies lovingly<br/>
       and will serve<br/>
         ‘till she<br/>
            dies<br/><br/>
