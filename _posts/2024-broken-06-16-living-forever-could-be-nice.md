### Living Forever Could Be Nice

Last summer, I was thinking about longevity research while driving around Maine looking at land for sale.

Below is a positive thought that came to mind.

-----
<p>
I think when we cure aging, it'll be emotionally similar to what people experience when they reach absolute financial freedom.
</p>

<p>
I once read about a woman who hit her financial freedom goal. The goal was something like a net worth of $7 million. 
</p>

<p>
She described it as an unbelievable feeling of joy, freedom, and lightness. She said that, if anything, the experience is underrated.
</p>

<p>
As with the old trope that "money isn't important", what we wish were true (that she felt nothing) couldn't be further from the truth.
</p>

<p>
Also interesting was what happened <i>after</i> she achieved financial freedom.
She said her wealth grew faster afterwards
She worked more in alignment with her personal missions, took more calculated risks, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Mark Cuban was once asked "What's the best thing about being a billionaire? The worst?".
His answer was "Everything. Nothing.". https://news.yahoo.com/news/best-worst-things-being-billionaire-183500017.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMsKyh9r2x52lUuql68zC_XsKUG5h393JCpMTie72p3vIEo15dSZW42ZnnWBke2yjsPJsPpNkgRFixLgCVrBEWysWchhD113fRTabtHVn4mdS3enIoxUOlpVhkqTpGuHhfTKXB9l_NiQA2UT3GMzsklIhuVIuSk-lxXlT9uu1iKZ
</p>

<p>
I think solving the ability to live as long as one likes will be similar.
I think the potential downsides, such as logistical problems, are oversold.
Humans are good at problem-solving...though usually only once the problem is looming.
</p>

<p>
Imagine if Eratosthenes, Euler, Edison, Einstein, von Neumann, da Vinci, Tesla, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel were all still alive and well today, each with a career hundreds or thousands of years long.
We might be Kardashev Type-II or Type-III already.
</p>

<p>
I also don't think the possibility of curing aging, longevity escape velocity, etc. is necessarily millenarian.
There's been effective research in lab animals and some verified age reversal in humans (https://gwern.net/doc/longevity/epigenetics/2019-fahy.pdf).
The image at the top of this post shows the anchoring effect humans currently experience.
</p>

<p>
That anchoring appears to be due to the Hayflick limit. -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit
The Hayflick limit is the total number of times a human cell can divide. -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit
Once you hit the limit, the cell stops dividing, the tissue starts to die, and so does the person.
It's like a candle burning through its wax.<br/><br/>

I think AI can help solve this.
</p>

<p>
Hydras, the small freshwater sea creatures, are cellularly immortal.
<put the image here>

</div>
Hydras do not die of old age, and in fact do not age at all.
They have an infinite capacity to reset their cells to a "fresh" state.<br/><br/>

"Research today appears to confirm Martinez' study. Hydra stem cells have a capacity for indefinite self-renewal. The transcription factor "forkhead box O" (FoxO) has been identified as a critical driver of the continuous self-renewal of Hydra.[26] In experiments, a drastically reduced population growth resulted from FoxO down-regulation." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(genus)
</p>

<p>
Proof that it's possible is a powerful thing.
And I think it'll be quite pleasant.
