I was thinking about longevity research while driving around Maine looking at land for sale last summer.

Below is a positive thought that came to mind.

-----
<p>
I think when we cure aging, it'll be emotionally similar to what people experience when they reach absolute financial freedom.

<p>
I once read about a woman who hit her personal financial freedom goal. It was something like a $7 million net worth. 

<p>
She described it as an unbelievable feeling of joy, freedom, and lightness. She said that, if anything, the experience is underrated.

<p>
As with the trope that "money isn't important", what we wish were true (that she felt nothing) couldn't be further from the truth.

<p>
Also interesting was what happened after she achieved financial freedom.
She said her wealth grew <i>faster</i> afterwards
She was able to work more fully in alignment with her personal missions, take more calculated risks, and so on.

<p>
Mark Cuban was once asked the best and worst parts of being a billionaire. His answer, now infamous: "best part: everything, worst part: nothing".

<p>
I think solving the ability to live as long as one likes will be similar.
I think the purported downsides, such as logistical problems, are quite oversold.
Humans are good at solving big problems...though usually only once the problem is right in front of us.

<p>
Imagine if Eratosthenes, Euler, Edison, Einstein, von Neumann, da Vinci, Tesla, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel were all still alive and health today, each with a career hundreds or thousands of years long.
We might be Kardashev Type-II or Type-III already.

<p>
I also don't think the possibility of curing aging, longevity escape velocity, etc. is necessarily millenarian.
There's been effective research in lab animals and some verified age reversal in humans (https://gwern.net/doc/longevity/epigenetics/2019-fahy.pdf).
The image at the top of this post shows the anchoring effect humans currently experience.

<p>
That anchoring appears to be due to the Hayflick limit. -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit
The Hayflick limit is the total number of times a human cell can divide. -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit
Once you hit the limit, the cell stops dividing, and the tissue starts to die, and with it the person.
It's rather like a candle burning through all of its wax.

I think AI, if aligned properly, will accelerate solving this problem.

<p>
Hydras, the small freshwater sea creatures, are cellularly immortal.
<insert photo of a hydra>
Hydras do not die of old age, and in fact do not age at all.
They have an infinite capacity to reset their cells to a "fresh" state.

"Research today appears to confirm Martinez' study. Hydra stem cells have a capacity for indefinite self-renewal. The transcription factor "forkhead box O" (FoxO) has been identified as a critical driver of the continuous self-renewal of Hydra.[26] In experiments, a drastically reduced population growth resulted from FoxO down-regulation." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(genus)
</p>

<p>
Proof that it's possible is a powerful thing.
I think the biotechnological barriers to immortality will fall, perhaps within our lifetimes.
I think it'll be quite pleasant when they do fall.
