A few years ago, I spent some time living right near the ocean in Hampton, New Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
It's perhaps not well known that there's oceanfront in New Hampshire. There isn't much: a little strip of coastline.
<div align="center">
    <img style="height: 75%; width: 100%;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/Coastline-of-New-Hamsphire.png" />
</div>
</p>

<p>
Hampton is one of the towns on that coastline.
Both places I lived were right off a road that ran alongside the ocean.
The road is named Ocean Boulevard.
</p>

<p>
One of the condos I stayed in was at the back end of a parking lot a few hundred feet from the sidewalk along the seawall.
It was less than a 60-second walk to the beach. The sidewalk and the seawall:

</div>
</p>

<p>
The beach near the condo:

</div>
</p>

<p>
Everything about the condo was pleasant: the landlord, the off-street parking, the condo itself, and the ocean on its doorstep.
I worked remotely and cooked a lot of pan-grilled chicken.

</div>
</p>

<p>
The trick was renting the condo in the winter, when the price was low.
Most people don't go to the beach in cold New England winters.
</p>

<p>
I went for walks — usually at night — from the condo building, through the parking lot, to Ocean Boulevard, and then along the sidewalk by seawall above the beach.
Waves rolled in from the horizon and each broke with a muted hiss.

</div>
</p>

<p>
The town was quiet at night. Not many people on the sidewalk. A big sky over the ocean. Rhythmic crashing of the waves.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
I'd also sometimes walk right on the sand itself: sometimes closer to the water and sometimes further up, toward the seawall
</p>

<p>
I remember once picking my way across a section like this, looking for high spots so my feet didn't get wet:
<div align="center">
  <img style="height: 75%; width: 100%;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/Buildings-sand-water-and-rocks.jpg" />
</div>
</p>

<p>
The view from the edge of the waves:

</div>
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
I also spent time in a different condo on Ocean Boulevard, just down the road. That one had a direct oceanfront view.
It had a sliding glass window with a balcony overlooking the ocean:
<div align="center">
  <img style="height: 75%; width: 100%;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/oceanfront-condo-balcony.jpg" />
</div>
</p>

<p>
I worked from a desk off of the left-hand side of that photo.
Sometimes I'd leave the curtains open so I could rotate my desk chair and look at the waves.

<div align="center">
  <img style="height: 75%; width: 100%;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/view-from-condo.jpg" />
</div>
</p>

<p>
The condo was beach-themed, including this painting on the wall:
<div align="center">

</div>
</p>

<p>
Something I noticed throughout my time in Hampton was how soothing the sound of waves is.
I understood better why people pay such a premium for oceanfront properties.
</p>

<p>
It was like a little jetpack of calm.
Perhaps like going to a spa, or relaxing for hours with a cup of coffee at a cafe, there's an effect of having — straightforwardly and harmlessly in a crazy world — done something nice for yourself.

<p>
I once read a description, written by an introvert, of a day in the life of an introvert.
I can't remember the exact words of his description, but he said something like that he would not so much read a book as become engulfed by a book, captivated by the world within a book, lost in a book.
</p>

<p>
That's how I felt in Hampton.
More than a passing enjoyment of living near the ocean, I felt commanded by the experience.
Captivated and lost in the experience of the ocean.
</p>


That's how I felt in Hampton: captivated, transfixed, lost in the experience of the ocean.

I mention that to say that's how I felt in Hampton: captivated by the ocean - consumed, transfixed.

It was more that I felt captivated - consumed, transfixed.

Perhaps it would be too much to say becoming part of the book - of the imaginative world of the book, but it wouldn't be far off.

Henry David Thoreau wrote an entire book about walking.
<Add quotation from his book here, and elsewhere>

<Talk about the experience of working and looking over the ocean, Show the picture with my desk, put a note that all the photos are my own>
<mention that I don't have any complaints here - just felt like sharing>
<talk about grandma Nora and how she loved the beach>
<talk about how the brain naturally looks for problems, but not so much for serenity>
<talk about how Khalil Gibran used the ocean as a metaphor so much in his writing, and talk about how others have done the same, such as Sufi poets>
