<p>
A few years ago, I spent some time living right near the ocean in Hampton, New Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
It's perhaps not well known that there's oceanfront in New Hampshire. There isn't much: a little strip of coastline.
<div align="center">
    <img style="height: 75%; width: 100%;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/Coastline-of-New-Hamsphire.png" />
</div>
</p>

<p>
Hampton is one of the towns on that coastline.
The short driveway to one of the places I lived was right off a road that ran alongside the ocean.
The road was named "Ocean Boulevard".
</p>

<p>
The condo was at the far end of a parking lot a few hundred feet from a sidewalk that ran along the seawall next to the ocean.
It was less than a 60-second walk to the beach.

<p>
The beach near the condo:

</div>
</p>

<p>
Everything about the condo was pleasant: the easygoing landlord, the off-street parking, the condo itself, and the ocean.
I worked remotely and cooked a lot of pan-grilled chicken.

</p>

<hr/>

<p>
The trick was renting the condo in the winter, which brought the price way down.
Most people don't go to the beach in cold New England winters.
</p>

<p>
I went for walks — usually at night — from the condo building, through the parking lot, to Ocean Boulevard, and then along the sidewalk by seawall above the beach.
Waves rolled in from the horizon, each breaking with a muted hiss as it hit the sand.

</p>

<p>
The town was quiet at night. Not many people on the sidewalk. A big sky over the ocean. Rhythmic crashing of the waves.

</p>

<p>
I also spent time in a different condo on Ocean Boulevard, just down the road. That one had a direct oceanfront view.
It had a sliding glass window with a balcony overlooking the sea:

</div>

Beautiful.
</p>

<p>
I worked from a desk just off of the right-hand side of that photo.
Sometimes I'd leave the curtains open so I could rotate my desk chair occasionally and look out over the waves.

</p>

<p>
The condo 
</p>

<p>
Something I noticed, both from time spent on that balcony, and from the walks I took alongside the ocean, was how soothing the sound of the waves was.
I finally understood why people pay such a premium for oceanfront properties.
</p>

<p>
It was like a little jetpack of calm in my mind.
Perhaps like going to a spa, or relaxing for hours with a cup of coffee at a cafe, there's an effect of having — straightforwardly and harmlessly in a crazy crazy world — done something purely to be nice to yourself.
A sliver of self-love.
Maybe remove: We can often be quite hard on ourselves, especially those of us who are conscientious and hard-working by nature.

I once read a somehow quite moving description of a day in the life of an introvert, written by an introvert.
I can't remember the exact words of his descriptions, but he said something like that he would not so much read a book as become immersed in a book, captivated by a book, lost in a book.
</p>

<p>
I mention that to say that's how I felt in Hampton: captivated, transfixed, pleasantly lost in the experience of the ocean.

Beyond a sort of passing enjoyment of the experience of living near the ocean, I felt transfixed by it.
Captivated, immersed, pleasantly lost in the experience of the ocean.
</p>

I mention that to say that's how I felt in Hampton: captivated by the ocean - consumed, transfixed.

-> This is the one: >>> I mention that to say that's how I felt in Hampton: captivated, consumed, lost in the experience of the ocean.

More than enjoying the experience in a sort of incidental passing way, I felt captivated by the ocean: consumed, transfixed.

It was more that I felt captivated - consumed, transfixed.

Perhaps it would be too much to say becoming part of the book - of the imaginative world of the book, but it wouldn't be far off.

Henry David Thoreau wrote an entire book about walking.
<Add quotation from his book here, and elsewhere>

<Talk about the experience of working and looking over the ocean, Show the picture with my desk, put a note that all the photos are my own>
<mention that I don't have any complaints here - just felt like sharing>
<talk about grandma Nora and how she loved the beach>
<talk about how the brain naturally looks for problems, but not so much for serenity>
<talk about how Khalil Gibran used the ocean as a metaphor so much in his writing, and talk about how others have done the same, such as Sufi poets>
