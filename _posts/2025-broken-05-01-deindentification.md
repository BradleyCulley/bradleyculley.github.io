In Heideggerian philosophy, Geworfenheit (often translated as "thrownness") describes the human condition of being arbitrarily or passively "thrown" into existence and into a specific world, culture, and circumstances. It signifies the fact that we are not self-created but are given a pre-existing reality into which we are born, and which we have no control over.
