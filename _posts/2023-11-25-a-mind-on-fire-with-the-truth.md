When I think of Professor John von Neumann I am reminded of a reference I once read, to a description by Dante of a mind "on fire with the truth".

He can't be well-characterized monofactorially.

Major themes include mathematics, computing, physics, politics, and military work.

In each of those, he was world-changingly successful.
In mathematics, he founded multiple entirely new fields, including, most notably, game theory.

In politics and military work, he did critical work on the Manhattan project. He saved the world.

In computing, he invented the internal organizational architecture that is still used by most computers today.
It is called, straightforwardly, The von Neumann Architecture.
To quote, "The Von Neumann architecture consists of a single, shared memory for programs and data, a single bus for memory access, an arithmetic unit, and a program control unit."
-https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/von-neumann-architecture
He invented this architecture in 1945.
As if that were not enough, his reason for doing all this was a combination of saving the world and pioneering artificial intelligence. 1945!

On a personality level, he was super social and boisterous.
He loved parties and loud music. "[He] did some of his best work in noisy, chaotic environments, including with his wife's phonograph playing loudly". -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann
"[He] could attend parties until the early hours of the morning and then deliver a lucid lecture at 8:30.". -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann

He was a great leader, in both academic contexts and military contexts.
"Many considered him an excellent chairman of committees, deferring rather easily on personal or organizational matters but pressing on technical ones." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann

He was a successful husband and father, yet was once divorced. His daughter wrote a book, titled "The Martian's Daughter: A Memoir": https://www.amazon.com/Martians-Daughter-Memoir-Marina-Whitman/dp/0472035649

He was ethnically and culturally Jewish. He was sort of on the fence about theism, including literally opting for Pascal's Wager on his deathbed.

He escaped Hungary before The Holocaust. Defeating Nazism was, unsurprisingly, a deep and personal mission.

He also saw firsthand the effects of Soviet-era communism.
"During a Senate committee hearing he described his political ideology as 'violently anti-communist, and much more militaristic than the norm'" -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann

"Von Neumann entered government service primarily because he felt that, if freedom and civilization were to survive, it would have to be because the United States would triumph over totalitarianism from Nazism, Fascism and Soviet Communism" -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann

He was responsible in almost all aspects of his life, yet got arrested a number of times for reckless driving (including reading a book while driving).
Driving was apparently too boring. Reminiscent of Richard Feynman's last words: "I'd hate to die twice. It's so boring."

At 15 years old, he impressed mathematician Gábor Szegő so much with his mathematical abilities that Szegő wept tears of joy.

I think it's really the confluence of factors that that make the whole picture of von Neumann so fascinating.
What would a world with more von Neumanns, or all von Neumanns, would look like? Better, worse, unimaginably different?

------------------------------------------

"Throughout much of his career, he led a double life: as an intellectual leader in the ivory tower of pure mathematics and as a man of action, in constant demand as an advisor, consultant and decision-maker to what is sometimes called the military-industrial complex of the United States. My own belief is that these two aspects of his double life, his wide-ranging activities as well as his strictly intellectual pursuits, were motivated by two profound convictions. The first was the overriding responsibility that each of us has to make full use of whatever intellectual capabilities we were endowed with. He had the scientist's passion for learning and discovery for its own sake and the genius's ego-driven concern for the significance and durability of his own contributions. The second was the critical importance of an environment of political freedom for the pursuit of the first, and for the welfare of mankind in general.
I'm convinced, in fact, that all his involvements with the halls of power were driven by his sense of the fragility of that freedom. By the beginning of the 1930s, if not even earlier, he became convinced that the lights of civilization would be snuffed out all over Europe by the spread of totalitarianism from the right: Nazism and Fascism. So he made an unequivocal commitment to his home in the new world and to fight to preserve and reestablish freedom from that new beachhead.
In the 1940s and 1950s, he was equally convinced that the threat to civilization now came from totalitarianism on the left, that is, Soviet Communism, and his commitment was just as unequivocal to fighting it with whatever weapons lay at hand, scientific and economic as well as military. It was a matter of utter indifference to him, I believe, whether the threat came from the right or from the left. What motivated both his intense involvement in the issues of the day and his uncompromisingly hardline attitude was his belief in the overriding importance of political freedom, his strong sense of its continuing fragility, and his conviction that it was in the United States, and the passionate defense of the United States, that its best hope lay."

-Professor Marina von Neumann Whitman,
economist and the daughter of John von Neumann, pages xv–xvi

"Oh, France won't matter."

-von Neumann's prewar take on WWII

------------------------------------------

"To conclude, I would like to mention that the importance of accelerating approximating and computing mathematics by factors like 10,000 or more, lies not only in that one might thereby do in 10,000 times less time problems which one is now doing, or say 100 times more of them in 100 times less time, - but rather in that one will be able to handle problems which are considered completely unassailable at present.

I need not tell you that I shall be very gladly at your disposal at any time when you want more specific details about this subject"

-von Neumann to Commodore Louis L Strauss, on a proposal to build a computer in *1945*, page 236. I believe this computer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAS_machine

------------------------------------------

"In principle, he reasoned, there was no reason why some day a machine might not be built which not only could perform most of the functions of the human brain but could actually reproduce itself, i.e., create more supermachines like it. He proposed to present this paper at Yale, where he had been invited to give the 1956 Silliman Lectures."

-Clay Bair Jr., in Life Magazine, 25 February 1957

That's von Neumann on artificial general intelligence and even AI takeoff/intelligence explosion/AI superintelligence, in *1956*!

------------------------------------------

I read somewhere that von Neumann developed early computers actually specifically with the goal of building artificial general intelligence. He was thinking about these things in the 1930s; discussing them with Alan Turing, for example. And he was working on them hands-on, via machines such as EDVAC, ENIAC, and the IAS machine, in the 1940s.

"The first use of the concept of a singularity in the technological context is attributed to von Neumann, who according to [Stanisław] Ulam discussed the "ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue."
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann

The notes for the Silliman Lectures form the basis for Neumann's final book: The Computer and the Brain: https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Brain.../dp/0300181116.

von Neumann took with him to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center the manuscript he was preparing for the Silliman Lectures. It had become his singular focus during his last days. He planned to work on it during his hospital visit. It was during that hospital visit that he ultimately passed away, from bone cancer, in 1957.
