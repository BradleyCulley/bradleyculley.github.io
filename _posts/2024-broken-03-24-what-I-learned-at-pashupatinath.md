When I visited Pashupatinath, a very renowned and holy Hindu temple in Nepal, I saw death directly for the first time.
Among other things, I saw people being cremated just a few yards in front of me.

I learned 4 things, in order of importance, with #1 being the most important and #4 being the least important, although they're all important:

#1: the woman I should marry, spend the rest of my life with, and in whose arms I should die. As the song goes, "This woman is my destiny".
#2: what I should do for work/meaning/purpose in life: serve the poor through being a doctor and public health public intellectual,
in the way Dr. Paul Farmer did
#3: you will die. Aubrey DeGrey, or anyone else, will not solve aging before it's your time to go.
#4: there is no God. The world doesn't care about you. Life is indifferent to you.
Therefore, be practical. Be practical in your choice of career. Be practical in your life overall. There is no grander plan.
While they miss a lot of emotional and psychological nuance, the atheists are fundamentally correct.
This is known as "theodicy". "Stemming from theos (God) and dike (justice), a theodicy is an attempt to show how the justice, goodness and other features of God can be upheld in light of the evils in our world."
Turns out there's a simple answer: no God. You have to make your own.

Those four "messages" came through so clearly and so unbelievably intensely that they were like pictures more than words.
Afterwards, as I sat in the bus waiting to travel away from the temple in a bit of a dreamlike state.
I felt a certain realism and calm, and I think had an expression I'd seen many times on my father's face: love, realism, acceptance.
