<p>
I read a post on X recently, in which the author said he was sick of making children do things against their will every day of their lives
</p>

<p>
After a certain point in the 1600s, candidates for rulers of the Ottoman Empire were confined to house arrest until they ascended to the throne and took power.
The building to which they were confined was called "Kafes", which literally means "cage" in Turkish.
Shocking no one, Ottoman rulers came out of the literal cage unbelievably insane. 
</p>

<p>
An example of this is Sultan Ibrahim, who ruled the Ottoman Empire from 1640 to 1648.
He was known, rather un-creatively, as "Ibrahim the Mad".
Ibrahim the Mad was a sex addict and a wildly dysfunctional ruler.
</p>

<p>
Addiction is, of course, a textbook coping mechanism for traumatic life experiences.
Among other failures, Ibrahim the Mad's poor leadership led to the Cretan War (1645–1669), which, according to records at the time, claimed over 150,000 lives.
Ibrahim the Mad was eventually executed (by strangling!) at the direction of his mother (!), at the age of 32.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
As the X poster notes, it is indeed common practice to make children do things against their will more or less every day of their lives
The problem is: they don't stay children forever.
</p>

<p>
Like Ibrahim the Mad, they grow up and take power in the world.
It's perhaps no coincidence that the world shaped by adults is as insane as it.
</p>

<p>
The French philosopher Michel Foucault called this "biopower":
"For Foucault, biopower is a technology of power for managing humans in large groups; the distinctive quality of this political technology is that it allows for the control of entire populations."
</p>

<p>
In his 1975 book, "Discipline and Punish", Foucault observed that schools, prisons, military barracks, and hospitals each bear an uncanny resemblance to one other.
He termed them all "Disciplinary institutions".
</p>

<p>
In biology there's a maxim that "structure determines function".
A school and of a prison have eerily-many functional similarities: conformity, coordination, and compliance, to name a few.
Therefore, perhaps, the "structural" characteristics — and even the physical designs — of the aforementioned institutions follow accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Have you ever noticed how, even at a physical level, an American prison looks a lot like a more-secure version of an American public high school?
The dull, smooth, slate-grey concrete, the red, green, or blue pastel walls, the utilitarian windows, the red brick exteriors.
***TODO: add a picture of a prison, then below it a picture of a school** 
</p>

<p>
The standard rejoinder here is that schools must have some level of oppressive disciplinary control, in order to shape students into well-functioning adults.
Must they though?
And who determines the appropriate level of abuse?
</p>

<p>
Let us consider the case of the Judge Rotenburg Center in Canton, Massachussetts.
<blockquote>
The Judge Rotenberg Center (JRC) is a controversial institution in Canton, Massachusetts, United States, for people with developmental disabilities and emotional and behavioral disorders.
The center has been condemned for torture by the United Nations special rapporteur on torture, and is known for its use of the graduated electronic decelerator (GED), a device that administers electric shocks to residents as part of the institution's behavior modification program.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
In other words, it's a school that tortures children by administering painful electric shocks directly to their bodies.
The students - and I'm not making this up - literally wear special backpacks all day at school that specifically and solely serve the purpose of being able to deliver painful electic shocks via electrical nodes attaches to the students' limbs.
Each backpack contains a battery pack and an antenna.
Here's a photo of one:
**TODO insert a photo of one**
</p>

<p>
This is the video of the young man pictured at the top of this page being forcibly tortured while tied down to a "restraining board" on the floor of the "school": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcxpGKctZMs.
He was restrained in this way for 7 hours straight and received 31 separate electric shocks, each so painful that they literally burned scars into his arms and legs.

<blockquote>
In 2002, a young man, Andre McCollins, at the Judge Rotenberg Center (JRC) refused to take his coat off when instructed to. What followed was an ordeal more than 7 hours long, in which Andre McCollins was tied to a restraint board and shocked 31 times while he with crying out, “Please stop, please stop” When it was over, McCollins had burned wounds on his arms and legs. McCollins sued and in 2012 the lawsuit went to court.
</blockquote>

As you may have already guess, the judge ruled that this was acceptable, and allowed this practice to continue.

<blockquote>
In the courtroom they heard that McCollins was shocked after he was restrained, for "tensing up his body."
McCollins Mother testified saying that even after 10 years since that brutal day, Andre has never been the same again.
</blockquote>

</p>

Perhaps the craziest thing about the JRC is that we as a society think that we can have it in our midst and that there will be no serious consequences for doing so

Also add the fact that among the craziest, most abusive, most evil people I've met in life, a commonality I've gleaned is their experience of crazy childhoods.
One person, who emotionally tortured me for about a year at a job earlier in my career, once told us about his father literally dropping he and his siblings into the literal deep end of a swimming pool as a way of encouraging the development of their swimming skills.

Then add the Martin Shkreli quote about 100% of every person he met in prison having had an insane childhood to the essay

Add to the afraid of the latest say the vessel a quote about lowercase t versus capital t trauma that he's never really had a client that didn't have **unbelievably** crazy things happened to them when he really dug into it

On the flip side, there's the story of  James H. Fallon, an emeritus professor of anatomy and neurobiology in the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, and author of "The Psychopath Inside: A Neuroscientist's Personal Journey into the Dark Side of the Brain".
In short, while researching clinical psychopathy (formally known as antisocial personality disorder, which is a genetic condition that one is either born with or not), he discovered that he himself had the genetic phenotype of psychopathy.
He didn't have the criminally-oriented symptoms, however. He was a lifeline well-adjusted, productive, harmonious member of society.
A successful professor, husband, and father.
He described himself as a "pro-social psychopath", and attributed that fact to a happy childhood.
The clinical evidence supports his claim: psychopathy is strictly a genetic <i>predisposition</i>, not a pre-destiny of certain behavior that's typical of psychopaths (e.g. literal murder).

<p>
I have a few ripostes - to, in homage to Foucault, use a French term.
</p>

Ripostes:<br/>
1. Let's take a one massive step back. Implicit in the above statement about controlling children is the normalization of the assumption of control over another human being. We normalize effective total imperative control over children, often against their will, in a way that we would rebuke for adults. If I decided I was going to commit an innocent random adult to decades of institutionalization, potentially including literal torture, against their will, I'd be arrested for kidnapping. The implicit "yeah but..." one can all but hear is the symptom of what Foucault called a "discourse". Like the idea that it's normal you'll get yelled at (and maybe smacked around a little) in military bootcamp, the Foucauldian idea of a "discourse" is that of a normalizing, totalizing, meta-narrative with an emphasis of power relations (TODO add citation). "It's normal for prisoners to work for an average of $0.86/hour". "It's normal for the government to censor political speech". "It's normal to drag your children around on a literal leash". "Normal" doesn't exist in nature. Normal is constructed by human beings, and when it's deeply ingrained enough in a culture, it feel like the air we breathe: we don't even notice it.
2. The anti-natalist argument: what gave you the right to create children at all? That one goes with logos (meaning), telos (purpose, end goals), and so on. Absenting all that, a more generative, more directed question would be: would we allow the government to spawn adult prisoners like lab meat. Create 'em lock 'em up from the moment they exist? We permit incarceration as a penal institution as being compensatory for the transgressions of the incarcerated individual, but a newborn child is an innocent being. It has committed no transgressions.
3. The third, most pragmatic, riposte is the Nordic one. Schools in Finland use a "child-centric" approach to learning. Zero standardized testing other than a single test at the end of high school, exploratory learning - with an aim to spark students' curiosity about the world, an emphasis on play, and a foundational emphasis on student well-being. It's perhaps not coincidental that - admittedly speaking with sweeping generality - Finland, both internally as a society and externally as a nation-state on the geopolitical world stage, has never really done anything crazy. Never colonized anywhere, never started preemptive wars, never held prisoners for years without due process, never extrajudicially executed people with Reaper drones, never tortured their prisoners, and so on. -TODO add citations for the Finnish schools facts

"For as children tremble and fear everything in the blind darkness, so we in the light sometimes fear what is no more to be feared than the things that children in the dark hold in terror and imagine will come true"
-Lucretius, from the poem "De Rerum Natura"
</p>

Add to the afraid of the light essay the prison stuff. The main prison with the guy being sprayed maybe. The Georgia prisons with a violation of their constitutional rights. The wing correctional essay and mother Jones and or it talks about the sexual slaves there. And tie it back to recidivism. You expect someone to endure these conditions and come out a well-functioning will adjusted member of society. That's a bit much.
