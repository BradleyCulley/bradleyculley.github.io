### College is For Learning

<br/>
<p>
    <b>I treated college as a time to learn things, broadly-speaking, rather than as a vocational program.
    Reactions to this included horror, displeasure, haughtiness, enthusiasm, appreciation, and the most common: confusion mixed with mild disdain.</b>

    First of all, why didn't I treat college like a vocational program?
    After all, everyone needs a way to earn a living, and in the path I was on in life, college would be a key part of that?
    Was it laziness? Stupidity? Idealism?

TODO: talk about how important narrative is humans. Maybe cite the dream example.
The thing about narrative is that *you*, the human thrown into this world, living your own life,
gets to, to some degree at least, select the narrative of your life.
You can try to start a business and fail, and view it as trauma or view it as a learning experience,
or even view it as an essentially complete success, because you had the courage to do something that scared you.
This sounds like nausea-inducing self-help pablum, but it's actually, literally, true.
There's an entire branch of psychotherapy called "narrative therapy", which uses shaping one's self-narratives
as a means to address psychological problems.
In tightly-controlled scientific research studies, it's proven to be quite effective: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1697260024000851#:~:text=The%20results%20showed%20that%20narrative,results%20were%20robust%20and%20reliable.
If you think back to the most miserable people you've ever met in life, and you think about the ones you got to know well, they often had a negative narrative about themselves.
Helplessness, pain, frustration.
