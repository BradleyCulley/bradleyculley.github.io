### Seven Weeks in Wheeling

<br/>
<p>
    <b>I treated college as a time to learn things, broadly-speaking, rather than as a vocational program.
    Reactions to this included horror, displeasure, haughtiness, enthusiasm, appreciation, and the most common: confusion mixed with mild disdain.</b>

<p>
    First of all, why didn't I treat college like a vocational program?
    After all, everyone needs a way to earn a living, and in the path I was on in life, college would be a key part of that?
    Was it laziness? Stupidity? Idealism?
