### N-Ary Life

<p>
    <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">
        Decision-making over a lifetime is traversing a giant tree of options.
        Those who succeed are like skilled craftspeople at the game of life.

</p>

<p>
The "n" in "n-ary tree" refers to the maximum number of branches coming out of each node in the tree.
</p>

<p>
A 2-ary tree looks like this:
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img style="height: 50vh;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/binary-tree.png" />
</div>
</p>

<p>
A 3-ary tree:
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img style="height: 50vh;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/ternary-tree.png" />
</div>
</p>

<p>
And an n-ary tree:
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img style="height: 30vh;" src="https://bradleyculley.github.io/images/n-Ary-tree.png" />
</div>
</p>

<p>
And a lifetime of decisions:

</div>
</p>

<p>
The sheer number of decisions one makes, between birth and death, is enormous.
</p>

<p>
In our memories, we distill the most salient, such as choosing a spouse.
But there are so many more that matter greatly.
Whether to talk to that stranger who seems a bit too friendly.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Whether to slow down and tie your shoes before walking down the stairs.
Every year, 12,000 people die in stairway-related accidents. -https://www.attorneywdkickham.com/stairway-staircase-accidents.html#:~:text=Consider%20these%20statistics%20from%20the,are%2012%2C000%20stairway%20accident%20deaths.
Stairway accidents are the second leading cause of injury in the United States, second only to motor vehicle accidents. -https://www.attorneywdkickham.com/stairway-staircase-accidents.html#:~:text=Consider%20these%20statistics%20from%20the,are%2012%2C000%20stairway%20accident%20deaths.
These decisions are seemingly trivial but actually consequential.
</p>

<p>
As with the stairway accidents, surprisingly-many decision paths lead to really bad outcomes: death, incapacitation, imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
There's also stochasticity: random crimes, random weather events, random diseases.
Non-smoker lung cancer, for example.
What a maze!
</p>

<p>
Intrusive thoughts, self-sabotage, fake friends.
</p>

<p>
All cultures I'm aware of venerate the elderly as a general principle.
</p>

<p>
Putting aside other reasons to venerate the elderly, an elderly person has exhibited a certain impressive technical skill, just to get to old age.
The ancient Greeks had a special word, technê, for practical knowledge.
They had a separate word, epistêmê, for purely theoretical knowledge.
String theory would be epistêmê.
How to behave in a job interview would be technê.
</p>

<p>
Socrates, the great Greek philosopher, believed that technê - practical knowledge - is the most important kind of knowledge.
The pinnacle of knowledge, one could say.  -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techne, or https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/episteme-techne/
</p>

<p>
I've noticed a certain practicality of knowledge among older people in good social standing.
Like the prize-winning fighter, they may not know a lot of martial arts theory, but they're good at the stuff that matters. 
</p>

<p>
In 2012, I was doing a work-share on a farm in New Hampshire.
One day, one of the farmers and I were weeding a flower garden, chatting as we worked side-by-side.
She was 68 years old, and by all accounts had "won the game of life".
</p>

<p>
She'd been happily married for over 40 years, had three successful children, a big house, good health, and good friends.
At one point, a bit out of the flow of the conversation, she paused for a minute and said "relationships are the most important thing in life".
