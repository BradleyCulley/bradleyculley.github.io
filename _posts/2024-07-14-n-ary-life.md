### N-Ary Life

<p>
    <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">
        Decision-making over a lifetime is traversing a giant tree of choices.<br/>
        Those who succeed are like skilled craftspeople at the game of life.

<p>
In particular, it's like what in computing is called an "N-ary tree".
The "n" in "n-ary tree" refers to the maximum number of branches coming out of each node in the tree.
</p>

<p>
A 2-ary tree looks like this:
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
</p>

<p>
A 3-ary tree:
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
</p>

<p>
An n-ary tree:
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
</p>

<p>
A lifetime of decisions:

</div>
</p>

<p>
The sheer number of decisions one makes between birth and death is enormous.
</p>

<p>
In our memories, we distill the most salient decisions, such as choosing a spouse.
There are so many more, though, that matter greatly.
For example, whether to talk to that stranger who seems a bit too friendly.
</p>

<p>
"We take risks all the time when we speak to people.
When we engage with someone and trust them, we are taking a risk."¹<br/>
-David Belle
</p>

<p>
Whether to slow down and tie your shoes before walking down the stairs.
Every year, 12,000 people die in stairway-related accidents.²
Stairway accidents are the second leading cause of injury in the United States, second only to motor vehicle accidents.²
</p>

<p>
As with stairway accidents, surprisingly-many decision paths lead to really bad outcomes: death, incapacitation, imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
There's also plain randomness: random crimes, random weather events, random diseases.
Non-smoker lung cancer, for example.
</p>

<p>
Intrusive thoughts, self-sabotage, fake friends.
</p>

<p>
All cultures I'm aware of venerate the elderly as a general principle.
Putting aside other reasons to venerate the elderly, an elderly person in good social standing has exhibited a certain technical skill just to get to old age.
</p>

<p>
The ancient Greeks had a special word, technê, for practical knowledge.
They had a separate word, epistêmê, for theoretical knowledge.
String theory would be epistêmê.
How to behave in a job interview would be technê.
</p>

<p>
The Greek philosopher Socrates believed that technê - practical knowledge - is the most important kind of knowledge.
The pinnacle of knowledge, one could say.³
</p>

<p>
I've noticed a certain practicality of knowledge among the elderly in good social standing.
Like the prize-winning cage fighter, they may not know a lot of martial arts theory, but they're good at what matters. 
</p>

<p>
In 2012, I was doing a work-share on a farm in New Hampshire.
One day, one of the farmers and I were weeding a flower garden, chatting as we worked side-by-side.
She was 68 years old, and by all accounts had "won the game of life".
She'd been happily married for over 40 years, had three successful children, a big house, good health, and good friends.
</p>

<p>
At one point, a bit out of the blue, she paused for a minute and said "relationships are the most important thing in life".
