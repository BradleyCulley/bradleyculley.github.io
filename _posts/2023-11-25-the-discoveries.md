------------------------------------------

Received this book as a gift from my grandfather. He had excellent taste in books, and in many other things.
He was a medical doctor with strong well-developed intellectual passions outside of medicine. They included mathematics, computing, and philosophy.

Each chapter is a different breakthrough scientific paper from the 20th century, as well as commentary on it.

Alan Lightman is distinctive in being both a fully-qualified professor of astrophysics as well as a highly accomplished writer.
He received degrees in physics from Princeton University (A.B.) and Caltech (Ph.D.).
In the latter, he studied under the now Nobel Laureate astrophysicist Kip Thorne. 

As a writer, apart from "The Discoveries", he wrote the international bestseller "Einstein's Dreams", and the National Book Award finalist "The Diagnosis".
He is a professor of both astrophysics and the humanities, one of the first people at MIT to receive such a joint appointment.
Almost impossibly, he's a real-deal scientist, having published astrophysical research papers in journals including _Physical Review_ and _Nature_.  

At MIT, he's led an initiative to help grow students' communication skills, perhaps to match their indisputable technical skills:
"He played a major role in establishing MIT's "Communication Requirement," which requires all undergraduates to receive training each of their four years in writing and speaking."

Some chapters I particularly liked:
