The 1939 New York World's Fair - that so transfixed me as a small visitor from darkest Brooklyn - was about "The World of Tomorrow." Merely by adopting such a motif, it promised that there would *be* a world of tomorrow, and the most casual glance affirmed that it would be better than the world of 1939. Although the nuance wholly passed me by, many people longed for such a reassurance on the eve of the most brutal and calamitous war in human history. I knew at least that I would be growing up in the future. The sleek and clean "tomorrow" portrayed by the Fair was appealing and hopeful. And something called science was plainly the means by which that future would be realized.
</p>

<p>
But if things had gone a little differently, the Fair could have given me enormously more. A fierce struggle had gone on behind the scenes. The vision that prevailed was that of the Fair's president and chief spokesman, Grover Whalen - former corporate executive, New York City police chief in a time of unprecedented police brutality, and public relations innovator. It was he who had envisioned the exhibit buildings as chiefly commercial, industrial, oriented to consumer products, and he who had convinced Stalin and Mussolini to build lavish national pavilions. (He later complained about how often he had been obliged to give the fascist salute.) The level of the exhibits, as one designer described it, was pitched to the mentality of a twelve-year-old.
</p>

<p>
However, as recounted by the historian Peter Kuznick of American University, a group of prominent scientists - including Harold Urey and Albert Einstein - advocated presenting science for its own sake, not just as the route to gadgets for sale; concentrating on the way of thinking and not just the products of science. They were convinced that broad popular understanding of science was the antidote to superstition and bigotry; that, as science popularizer Watson Davis put it, "the scientific way is the democratic way." One scientist even suggested that widespread public appreciation of the methods of science might work "a final conquest of stupidity" - a worthy, but probably unrealizable, goal.
</p>

<p>
As events transpired, almost no real science was tacked on to the Fair's exhibits, despite the scientists' protests and their appeals to high principles. And yet, some of the little that was added trickled down to me and helped to transform my childhood. The corporate and consumer focused remained central, though, and essentially nothing appeared about science as a way of thinking, much less as a bulwark of a free society.

<p>
Quite an incredible book. It's his final book: published in 1997, a year after his death.
</p>

<p>
 He was working on it I believe until shortly before his death. I think it's a sort of unrestrained exposition on the issues and views he held to be most important.
</p>

<p>
    Two of the chapters I found most interesting were Chapter 11, "The City of Grief" and Chapter 18, "The Wind Makes Dust".
</p>

<p>
    "The City of Grief" spoke to Sagan's experience interacting directly with the public.
    He soliticted letters via Parade Magazine, about his ideas on skepticism and scientific inquiry.
    What surprised Sagan was that the responses were overwhelmingly ignorant, and often clearly written by a person in significant emotional/psychological distress.
    Moving in the circles of high academia had perhaps sheltered Sagan from these realities.
    And thus the title, from a poem by Rainer Maria Rilke:
    ". . . how alien, alas, are the streets of the city of grief. 

    Rainer Maria Rilke, 
    'The Tenth Elegy' (1923)"

One thing I learned about Sagan that, for me, garnered a distinct respect for Sagan, is that he was arrested for trespassing - twice - for attempting to climb over a fence during a protest against nuclear weapons testing.
</p>

<p>
He was in his 50s, a full professor at Cornell, presumably quite wealthy, and world-famous at the time. He could have written a letter, but he went out and put his personal freedom at risk.
</p>

<p>
That's perhaps emblematic of Sagan more generally.
</p>

<p>
He spanned what is generally a chasmic divide between high intelligentsia (UChicago, Harvard, Cornell, writing a Pulitzer Prize-winning book) and mainstream popular culture (the film Contact, the TV show Cosmos, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Similarly, he spanned being an ivy-league professor - who usually operate solely in the realm of ideas - and physically getting out there and being arrested - twice - for his beliefs.
