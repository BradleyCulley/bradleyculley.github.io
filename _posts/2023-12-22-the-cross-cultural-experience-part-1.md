<p><b>One thing I found through travel and learning languages is that culture shock is less about what's different, and more about what's completely absent, in both directions.</b></p>

<p>In the new culture, the things that were so obviously important, part of daily life - the North Stars of your worldview - are not just less important, they're nonexistent.</p>

<p>This experience makes real the seemingly tiresome academic notion that human values are culturally relative.
We think, "Yes I get it: they're not so focused on high-quality ingredients in their cuisine."
Or "They don't sue each other at the metaphorical drop of a hat". But that's not it.</p>

<p>The real thing is the ancient Roman practice of human sacrifice through bloodsport at The Colosseum.
An estimated 400,000 people were murdered at The Colosseum in Rome, over the course of about 350 years, every one surrounded by an enthusiastic crowd.
Imagine getting up bright and early to see a gladiator fight.
Your friends and family are super excited. Today's the big day.</p>

<p>Socially-accepted human sacrifice like that is a practice so culturally distant that it feels otherworldly.</p>

<p>That's the one direction: things the other culture does that yours does not.
The other direction, however, is more the direction of what Freud called a "lost love".
For Freud, a lost love could be a person, but it could also be a deeply held ideal or truth.
In this context, things present in your culture, and absent in the new one.</p>

<p>Maybe nobody cares about your academic credentials because it's a "tough guy" society.
Or maybe it's a "Six-Pack-Joe-The-Plumber" society, in which the literally hands-on work of skilled trades, firefighters, and so on holds a primacy so presuppositionally sacrosanct as to seem, quite simply, obvious.</p>

<p>Baking the perfect baguette. Helping the powerless versus abusing the powerless.
Being a good Little League coach, securing particular burial rites.
The axioms of your childhood - those stars in the sky - while oftentimes powerful and reasonable, were cultural motifs all along.</p>

<p>The effect is really a double dose.
That's because anyone of reasonable intellect must conclude that it's not just the cultural motifs of society A that are not, in fact, some fundamental laws of life, but rather that neither those of A _nor_ those of B are.</p>

<p>And so, what remains?</p>

<p>French sculptor Bruno Catalano was born in Morocco in 1960. With his family, he immigrated to France at the age of 10.</p>

<p>He later created a series of statues titled "Les Voyageurs", which is French for "The Travelers".</p>

<p>Each statue is missing a piece of their body, symbolizing that lost love.</p>
