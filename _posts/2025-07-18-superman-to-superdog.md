## <div align="center">Superman to Superdog</div>

<p>
An updated version of a poem I wrote for a poetry class in college in 2009.
The name of the class was "The Writing of Poetry".
</p>

<p>
The title of the poem is "Superman to Superdog".
At the risk of sounding like a paper for an 11th-grade English class, I'll say that the poem explores themes of solitude, bravery, alienation, duty, family, love, and time.

<div style="text-align: center">

<p>
<b style="font-size: 20px;">Superman to Superdog</b>
</p>

<p>
He sits above me on a pillar<br/>
in The Fortress of Solitude
</p>

<p>
"Why a Fortress of Solitude," I say,<br/>
"when you’re already alone?".<br/>
"Solitude is my nature", he says
</p>

<p>
I’m stretched out below him,<br/>
amid the icy peaks.<br/>
I claw little furrows into the frost.
</p>

<p>
"You could fight crime without the Superman costume, you know".<br/>
"Many things I can do here, Superdog".
</p>

<p>
He smooths a wrinkle near his knee.<br/>
"The Kent disguise allows me to be with the people", he says.<br/>
"The people?" I ask.<br/>
He looks down at me,<br/>
a frown on that stony jaw.
</p>

<p>
"Lois Lane knows this place", I say.<br/>
"Truth, Justice, and the American Way," he says, quietly but firmly.
</p>

<p>
"She’ll die, you know."<br/>
"You could fly her to the Rose Nebula,<br/>
but the trip would take a thousand years."
</p>

<p>
He snaps his eyes straight ahead. He begins:<br/>
"My father, Jor-El, sent me to this planet. He gave me a mission...".<br/>
He trails off, perfectly still up there.
</p>

<p>
It’s the speech—the only words from his parents.<br/>
He listens to it every night,<br/>
from the crystals.
</p>
