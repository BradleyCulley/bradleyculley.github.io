-The idea of the perception versus the reality of a given job.
You must find out what the reality, and be at least ok with the reality.

-a job is something people (some people, most people, etc.) either:
a) don't want to do.
For example, fast food worker, although I used to be a fast food worker at Dominoes Pizza and I liked a lot of things about the job.
I had a great boss though, so I was lucky.
AND/OR
a) aren't able to do.
Surgeon, pilot.

Note that some jobs, for some people, are both: some people are both not licensed surgeons, AND would hate being surgeons.

It's worth keeping this in mind. A very small percentage of people enjoy everything about their job, all the time.

-your first job is not your last job. Prepare to start small to finish large.

-your job is a launchpad, not a prison. Be thankful for a boring job that pays the bills and lets you save a bit.
You're building up for the day you create cashflowing and/or sufficiently appreciating assets.
You're also avoiding a whole lot of the troubles of the world.

-which brings me to my next point. A job solves almost all problems in life.
Even a lowly job engenders a respect from society at large that is difficult-neigh-impossible to obtain whilst unemployed.

-office jobs are fine. Ignore the cultural mimetics disparaging office jobs. Those people are losers.
Also ignore the people saying an office job can't make you wealthy.
Read an objective study on the matter, such as The Millionaire Next Door.
What you'll find is that office jobs are an extremely common way to become plenty wealthy.
Steve Ballmer worked an office job all the way to being worth tens of billions of dollars.
Dr. Jonas Salk worked an office and cured polio.
Dr. David Ho worked an office job and found a cure for AIDs so revolutionary that people were sent home from hospice because they simply weren't going to die any more.

You don't have to justify your office job to anyone serious.
The surfer dude yoga teacher types might get snarky about it, but you can safely ignore them.
