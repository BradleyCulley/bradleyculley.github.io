<br/>
One thing I found through travel and learning languages, is that culture shock is less what about what's different and more about what's completely absent, in both directions.<br/><br/>

In the new culture, the things that were so obviously important, part of daily life, the north stars of your worldview, are not just less important - they're nonexistent.<br/><br/>

This experience makes real the seemingly tiresome academic notion that human values are culturally relative.
We think, "yeah yeah I get it, culture x wears those special hats, and culture y doesn't sue each other over everything".
But that ain't it.<br/><br/>

The real thing is ancient Roman human sacrifice, though bloodsport at The Colosseum.
An estimated 400,000 people were murdered at the Colosseum, every time surrounded by an enthusiastic crowd.
Imaging getting up bright and early to see a gladiator fight.
Your friends and family are super excited. Today's the big day.<br/><br/>

That's the one direction: things the other culture does that yours doesn't.
The other direction, however, is the more devastating direction.
Namely, things that were present in your culture, and irrelevant in the new one.<br/><br/>

Maybe nobody cares about your academic credentials because it's a "tough guy" society.
Or it's a "six-pack Joe The Plumber" society in which the literal hands-on work of skilled trades, firefighters, and so on holds a primacy so unshakeable as to seem presuppositionally obvious.<br/><br/>

Baking the perfect baguette. Helping the powerless versus abusing the powerless.
Being a good Little League coach, securing particular burial rights.
The axioms of your childhood - those stars in the sky - while oftentimes powerful and reasonable, were cultural motifs all along.<br/><br/>

The effect is a double dose, really.
That's because anyone of reasonable intellect must conclude that it's not just the cultural motifs of society A that are not, after all, some fundamental laws of life, but neither those of A _or_ B are.<br/><br/>

And so, what remains?<br/><br/>

French sculptor Bruno Catalano was born in Morocco in 1960. With his family, he immigrated to France at the age of 10.<br/><br/>

He later created a series of statues titled "Les Voyagers", which is French for "The Travelers".<br/><br/>

Each statue is missing a piece of their body, symbolizing the piece of one's soul lost in the journey to another land.<br/><br/>
