Who's an essay about my interview experience with Capital One with all the descriptive details.
The very nice interviewer, the inexplicably combative interviewer,
the business case interviewer, the recruiter, the stressed but very nice lead-of-some-kind engineer,
the themed rooms and the tone/mood with which they were described by the person giving the tour,
the cool engineering manager/director, the food, the stress, how it seemed crowded with people,
the original invitation to interview, the online assessment I did and got 100% correct per the tests,
then getting auto-rejected, then when the next recruiter reached out they put me through,
then being told I'd interview for a role the master software engineer level and then
after the full-day onsite interview being told I'd actually get leveled lower,
then being told that the team was growing quickly and so I should expect to be promoted to master software engineer,
and become a team lead, within 6 months or so. I responded by saying can we write that into the contract?
That is to say, if that doesn't happen, it'll be a breach of contract and I'll receive compensation to be determined
for the termination of the contract by default by Capital One.
The conversation fizzled out at that point and that's the last I heard.
Folks from Capital One have reached out multiple times since, somehow always oblivious to my prior experience and offer.
No hassle.
