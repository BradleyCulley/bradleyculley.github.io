Who's an essay about my interview experience with Capital One with all the descriptive details.
The very nice interviewer, the inexplicably combative interviewer,
the business case interviewer, the recruiter, the stressed but very nice lead-of-some-kind engineer,
the themed rooms and the tone/mood with which they were described by the person giving the tour,
the cool engineering manager/director, the food, the stress, how it seemed crowded with people
