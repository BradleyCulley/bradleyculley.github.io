A few years ago, I spent some time living near the ocean in Hampton, New Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
It's perhaps not well known that there's oceanfront in New Hampshire. There isn't much: a little strip of coastline.

</p>

<p>
Hampton, New Hampshire is one of the towns on that coastline.
Both places I lived in Hampton were right off a road that ran alongside the ocean.
The road is named Ocean Boulevard.
</p>

<p>
One of the condos I stayed in was at the back end of a parking lot a few hundred feet from the sidewalk along the seawall.
It was less than a 60-second walk to the beach. This shows the sidewalk and the seawall:

</div>
</p>

<p>
I also spent time in a different condo on Ocean Boulevard, just down the road. That one had a direct oceanfront view.
It had a sliding glass door with a balcony overlooking the ocean:

</p>

<p>
I worked from a desk off of the left-hand side of that photo.
Sometimes I'd leave the curtains open so I could rotate the desk chair and look at the waves.

The beach near the condos:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Everything about each condo was pleasant: the landlord, the condo itself, and the ocean nearby.
It was winter, so the cost to rent each condo was low.
Most people don't go to the beach in cold New England winters.
</p>

<p>
I went for walks — usually at night — to Ocean Boulevard, and then along the sidewalk by the seawall.
Waves rolled in from the horizon, breaking with a muted sigh.

</div>
</p>

<p>
The town was quiet at night. Not many people on the sidewalk. Rhythmic crashing of the waves.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
Sometimes I'd walk right on the sand: sometimes closer to the water and sometimes further away, toward the seawall.
</p>

<p>
I remember once picking my way across a section of the beach like this, looking for high spots so my feet didn't get wet:

<p>
The view from the edge of the waves:

</div>
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
Something I noticed in Hampton was how soothing the sound of waves is.
I understood better why people pay a premium for oceanfront properties.
It was like a little jetpack of calm.

<p>
I once read a description, written by an introvert, of a day in the life of an introvert.
I can't remember the exact words of his description, but he said something like he would not so much read a book as become emotionally engulfed by a book, lost in a book.
</p>

<p>
That's how I felt in Hampton.
More than a passing enjoyment, I felt somehow engulfed by the experience of the ocean.
