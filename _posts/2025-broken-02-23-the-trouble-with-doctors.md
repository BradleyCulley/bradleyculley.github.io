The trouble with doctors includes convergent thinking, Time pressure induced simplification of what are often complex phenomena, what I will call medical simplification, what's that guy look up his name described as separating the patient from the environment and the environment from the society I think is what he was saying as well, give the example of women who express themselves and their breast cancer survival rates

Port of medical simplification is not listening. Give the example of the doctor who said I should use over the ear headphones after I told him that it was ear plugs that I was using that I thought might be causing the problem. He was so profoundly not listening that he didn't listen to the actual phonemes of the actual (most important) word that I actually spoke. I said very clearly ear plugs and he was so tuned out to the entire conversation that he heard earphones.

Having a hypothesis and working that hypothesis. Give the example of the dentist with the pulmonary stuff embolisms. Find out more details on what was going on there.

The point of this essay is not that I've been the victim of a lot of medical error (which I have), but rather to point out the bigger picture which is what's missing is systems thinking. Just as they focus on the body part instead of the whole body or the specifics of the pathology instead of the root cause of the pathology or the patient without the context of the environment so do we focus on let's say the individual doctor without the context of the medical industrial complex into which the doctor is embedded and the medical industrial complex into which the doctor is embedded without the context of the society in which the medical industrial complex emerged. It's not true that every society generates a medical industrial complex the likes of which we have in the United States. Sweden doesn't have a medical industrial complex like that Denmark doesn't have a medical industrial complex like that and
they spend far less money for far better health outcomes and heavy universal health care coverage. So if we continue zooming outwards what do we actually get to with the bedrock root cause phenomenon of which all these other phenomena are downstream consequences? I would argue that it's culture and I wrote an essay about that but you can read here.

Make sure to include the focus on the particular body part or tissue or pathology or aspect of the body that is out of normal tolerance without considering *why* it's out of normal tolerance

And not just the proximal why the root cause why. I should say by the way that I that I am not advocating for naturopathic medicine or healing crystals or you know eating garlic as a way to fix everything or anything like that. I'm actually very much on the other end of that spectrum I went to a math and science high school I have complete confidence in science and the scientific method. But I'm actually contending here is that the scientific method is not really being followed. A simacrulum of the scientific method is being phone as a consequence of various constraints discussed elsewhere in this essay such as the constraint of the medical industrial complex causing doctors to not have enough time to cancel with a given patient and or think about a given patient.

I don't believe in plant-based anything being better than non-plant-based a piori. I don't believe in therapeutics based on anything other than gold standard scientific evidence via rigorous double-blinded randomized controllized large scale multi-phase scientific research studies, analyzed with the full rigor of standard statistical analysis.

Doctors and scientists have no problem with "plant-based" or "natural" therapeutics.
Taxol, a popular anti-cancer drug, comes from a plant. Cisplatin, another popular anti-cancer drug, does not come from a plant and is not "natural".
What they have in common is they're both effective at treating cancer. The plant categorization and the "natural" categorization are irrelevant.

I don't believe that natural is somehow better than synthetic when it comes to let's say medication or even food as an a priori statement. Natural is orthogonal. What matters is what atoms form what molecules are in those therapeutics and how those molecules electrostatically bind to and otherwise interact with the molecules in your body. Or even in the case of let's say proton therapy the fundamental physical particles interact with the fundamental physical particles in your body. That's the actual truth. I just want to clarify that I'm not saying we need spiritual medicine I'm saying we need integrative medicine.

The most importantly we need a different culture around healthcare

Also mention in the essay the idea that the United States is a fairly warlike culture and so I think we struggle at a fundamental level with creating a purely healing environment. Give the example of the medical practice I went to where they stole my money and then they fought me about it for The better part of a year. When I would talk to someone there they would go into battle mode. I remember seeing multiple times this is supposed to be a healing environment a medical clinic is supposed to be a healing environment. You battling me in an attempt to gaslight me about me being financially violated by a medical corporation is not a healing experience nor was the original financial violation that is still yet to be rectified. Honestly didn't really know what to say because they couldn't understand the idea of a healing environment I think. The also give the example of the person in
Illinois who who recorded on my official medical record that I was whining or something like that.

I think it's no accident that the United States has gotten involved in and indeed started many of so many wars. If you think about who is held in high regard in American society one of the absolute pinnacles is active duty military members and military veterans. The country was founded by a war the country was let's say bolstered by many wars etc
