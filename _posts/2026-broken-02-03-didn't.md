<ul>
    <li>Heresy didn't cause plagues, natural disasters, or the end of the world</li>
    <li>World War I wasn't the war to end all wars</li>
    <li>Communism didn't fix the problems of the proletariat</li>
    <li>The Cold War didn't result in nuclear war</li>
    <li>Vietnam becoming communist didn't result in the entire region turning communist: President Dwight D. Eisenhower's so-called "Domino theory"</li>
    <li>Neither moveable type, reading, radio, women's suffrage, films, television, women wearing whatever they want, rock and roll music, nor the internet resulted in societal breakdown. Honorable mention for the internet for getting close, though.</li>
    <li>Overpopulation didn't destroy the world, leading to widespread famines and so on, as Paul Erlich predicted</li>
    <li>Killer bees didn't kill everyone</li>
    <li>"Net neutrality" problems didn't firebomb any hope of an open, democratically accessible internet</li>
    <li>The world didn't, as Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, predicted, run out of copper around the year 2000</li>
    <li>Y2K didn't crash innumerable computer systems all over the world, wreaking worldwide havoc</li>
    <li>Television, films, social media, the internet, certain genres of music didn't haven't made people dumber or increased crime. IQ has been increasing ("the Flynn effect"), and crime decreasing, steadily for years.</li>
    <li>ISIS didn't take over the Middle East</li>
    <li>Artificial intelligence didn't take everyone's jobs within 6 months of ChatGPT coming onto the scene. Nor did it take everyone's jobs over many subsequent 6-month windows since then. "PhD-level" models can't spell "blueberry".</li>
</ul>
