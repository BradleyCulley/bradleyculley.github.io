Perhaps quote this entire speech by Carl Sagan at the start of the essay, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rmTK6-Ou4A
The clip you've referenced features Carl Sagan walking along the ocean and reflecting on humanity's dreams—both beautiful and troubling. This segment is from the final episode of his 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, titled "Who Speaks for Earth?"

Years ago, I read an opinion about the use of torture by the United States military at Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.
The author of the opinion argued that it's not only the victim of torture who must be accounted for, when accounting for the final and total effects of torture.
Rather, one must also consider the effects on the torturer.

The author said something like that one doesn't go home to the wife and kids after a long day of torturing people, cook up a batch of pancakes, and have a nice family dinner.
In Buddhism, this is known as "interdependent co-origination"

maybe use this? https://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~cgershensong/tendrel.html

I have a few ripostes - to, in homage to Foucault, use a French term.
</p>

Ripostes:<br/>
1. Let's take a one massive step back. Implicit in the above statement about controlling children is the normalization of the assumption of control over another human being. We normalize effective total imperative control over children, often against their will, in a way that we would rebuke for adults. If I decided I was going to commit an innocent random adult to decades of institutionalization, potentially including literal torture, against their will, I'd be arrested for kidnapping. The implicit "yeah but..." one can all but hear is the symptom of what Foucault called a "discourse". Like the idea that it's normal you'll get yelled at (and maybe smacked around a little) in military bootcamp, the Foucauldian idea of a "discourse" is that of a normalizing, totalizing, meta-narrative with an emphasis of power relations (TODO add citation). "It's normal for prisoners to work for an average of $0.86/hour". "It's normal for the government to censor political speech". "It's normal to drag your children around on a literal leash". "Normal" doesn't exist in nature. Normal is constructed by human beings, and when it's deeply ingrained enough in a culture, it feel like the air we breathe: we don't even notice it.
2. The anti-natalist argument: what gave you the right to create children at all? That one goes with logos (meaning), telos (purpose, end goals), and so on. Absenting all that, a more generative, more directed question would be: would we allow the government to spawn adult prisoners like lab meat. Create 'em lock 'em up from the moment they exist? We permit incarceration as a penal institution as being compensatory for the transgressions of the incarcerated individual, but a newborn child is an innocent being. It has committed no transgressions.
3. The third, most pragmatic, riposte is the Nordic one. Schools in Finland use a "child-centric" approach to learning. Zero standardized testing other than a single test at the end of high school, exploratory learning - with an aim to spark students' curiosity about the world, an emphasis on play, and a foundational emphasis on student well-being. It's perhaps not coincidental that - admittedly speaking with sweeping generality - Finland, both internally as a society and externally as a nation-state on the geopolitical world stage, has never really done anything crazy. Never colonized anywhere, never started preemptive wars, never held prisoners for years without due process, never extrajudicially executed people with Reaper drones, never tortured their prisoners, and so on. -TODO add citations for the Finnish schools facts

"For as children tremble and fear everything in the blind darkness, so we in the light sometimes fear what is no more to be feared than the things that children in the dark hold in terror and imagine will come true"
-Lucretius, from the poem "De Rerum Natura"
</p>

Add to the afraid of the light essay the prison stuff. The main prison with the guy being sprayed maybe. The Georgia prisons with a violation of their constitutional rights. The wing correctional essay and mother Jones and or it talks about the sexual slaves there. And tie it back to recidivism. You expect someone to endure these conditions and come out a well-functioning will adjusted member of society. That's a bit much.
