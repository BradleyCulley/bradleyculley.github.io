include saa magni and Denis quote about when old people die it's like burning a library and include the mind uploading piece quote and include the dream I had about Wil Smith, a man I never met and hadn't thought about in probably 25 years or so

This photo of Bruce Lee in his casket that has really stayed with me: TODO add photo (https://i0.wp.com/.../2015/11/Brucelee11-Khurki.net_.jpg...).
All of that ambition and discipline and drive and talent and energy and character were permanently and simply gone, without reason.

I once heard someone say, speaking of mind uploading, that in the future we'll look back at the current era with astonishment.
In this era which we carried around something as precious as our entire mind in this biological vessel - subject to innumerable risks of complete loss.
We do better with our hard drives.

Nonexistence is perhaps especially incongruous and inexplicable when someone young dies so suddenly. 
Even more so when they're a great person, like Bruce Lee. 
Oumou Sangare has a song title that captures this well: [Saa Magna - "Death is Terrible"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_YyroDeZrY).

<p>
Rather than focus on the tragedy of his early death, perhaps it's best to focus on how thoughtful, deep, and self-disciplined he was — to be able to identify, and so profoundly fulfill such essential aspects of life in his short time on this planet.
