        Some age-old problem are clearly unsolved.
        Other age-old problems are clearly solved, yet their solutions are often ignored.

    <li>
        <h3>What "human nature" is</h3>
        <p>
            This was often referenced in literature classes when I was in school.
            For example, it would be asserted that a piece of literature illuminated some aspect of human nature.
            But ok, what percent of human nature do we have figured out?
            Has anyone tried to stitch together all these little illuminations together into the actual answer?
            "Here's human nature. It's a 25,000-page book".
            Doesn't seem an unreasonable ask. The connectome of the human brain is finite.
            The analogous discovery and synthesis for calculus took place about 350 years ago. Hasn't changed since.
            It was a point of pride for my high school calculus teacher that what he was teaching was timeless and complete. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There's a phrase, popularized by the German physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond: "Ignoramus et ignorabimus". It's Latin for "we do not know and will not know".²
            That's an ethos I sensed in literary studies, and in art for that matter. A potentially deliberate lack of quantification.
            This is perhaps in part because of what would happen if you asked the average artist or poet "what's 600 divided by 15?", but I think it runs deeper in the type of mind that gravitates toward literature and the arts.
        </p>
        <p>
            About du Bois-Reymon's phrase, the great German mathematician David Hilbert, had this to say:<br/>
            "We must not believe those, who today, with philosophical bearing and deliberative tone, prophesy the fall of culture and accept the ignorabimus.<br/>
            For us there is no ignorabimus, and in my opinion none whatever in natural science.<br/>
            In opposition to the foolish ignorabimus our slogan shall be Wir müssen wissen – wir werden wissen ("We must know – we will know")."²<br/>
            The phrase is on Hilbert's tombstone:<br/>

        <h3>How to make people be good</h3>
        Fixing classism, solipsism, the abuse of power, etc.<br/>
        Mountains of human effort over the millennia. Countless moral systems.<br/>
        Maybe we're just more chimpanzee than bonobo.<br/>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Watchmaker Problem</h3>
        A watch is made by a watchmaker. The universe exists, so what created the universe?<br/>
        Why is there something rather than nothing? How could something come from nothing?<br/>
        The Big Bang is not an answer, by the way. The Big Bang just moves the problem.<br/>
        Nobody knows what caused the big bang, where the energy present at the start of the universe came from.<br/>
        Scientists don't know. Nobody knows.
    </li>
<ul>

<p>
Unsolved isn't unsolvable though
</p>

<p>
In their 1996 book, "The Demon-Haunted World"⁴, Ann Druyan and Carl Sagan cite a potential answer to the Watchmaker Problem.
They do so to illustrate the idea that the problem might be solvable, but that we haven't solved it yet.
The solution: the universe is infinitely old.
It was never created because it's always existed.
While an infinitely old universe doesn't jive with an everyday commonsense worldview, it _would_ solve the problem.<br/><br/>

From the book:

> A very different prospect for something like eternal life was once proposed by the versatile British scientist J.B.S. Haldane, who was, among many other things, one of the founders of population genetics. Haldane imagined a far future when the stars have darkened and space is mainly filled with a cold, thin gas. Nevertheless, if we wait long enough statistical fluctuations in the density of this gas will occur. Over immense periods of time the 192 The Fine Art of Baloney Detection fluctuations will be sufficient to reconstitute a Universe something like our own. If the Universe is infinitely old, there will be an infinite number of such reconstitutions, Haldane pointed out. So in an infinitely old universe with an infinite number of appearances of galaxies, stars, planets and life, an identical Earth must reappear on which you and all your loved ones will be reunited. I'll be able to see my parents again and introduce them to the grandchildren they never knew. And all this will happen not once, but an infinite number of times. But in this reflection I have underestimated what infinity means. In Haldane's picture, there will be universes, indeed an infinite number of them, in which our brains will have full recollection of many previous rounds. Satisfaction is at hand - tempered, though, by the thought of all those other universes which will also come into existence (again, not once but an infinite number of times) with tragedies and horrors vastly outstripping anything I've experienced this turn. The Consolation of Haldane depends, though, on what kind of universe we live in, and maybe on such arcana as whether there's enough matter eventually to reverse the expansion of the universe, and the character of vacuum fluctuations. Those with a deep longing for life after death might, it seems, devote themselves to cosmology, quantum gravity, elementary particle physics, and, especially, transfinite arithmetic.

    More recently, another British scientist, Roger Penrose - a 2020 Laureat of the Nobel Prize in Physics - developed a theory called "Conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC)", which holds there's always been a cycles of big bangs and big crunches, since literally forever ago.<br/>
    The theory was popularized in Penrose's 2010 book "Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe".<br/>
    Penrose claims there's experimental evidence of CCC, in the form of rings present the afterglow of the Big Bang.<br/>
    The afterglow of the Big Bang is known as the cosmic microwave background (CMB).<br/>
    This diagram from one of Penrose's papers on CCC shows the core idea - cycles of time:<br/>

    CCC, and its purported experimental evidence, are not widely accepted by the scientific community.<br/>
    Whether it's true or not isn't the point though: Penrose gave it a serious shot.
</p>

<p>
I've long been fascinated with problems like Fermat's Last Theorem.<br/>
There's a certain gravitas to a problem unsolved since 1637.<br/>
It has timelessness. There's epistemic humility: "this ain't easy".
</p>

<p>
This lens of thinking has helped me put purported solutions in perspective.<br/>
Did some dude just recently, in the year 2024, finally figure out how to have harmonious romantic relationships?<br/>
And he's shouting-ly marketing it to you somewhere?
</p>

<p>
I think of these in contrast with problems that _are_ solved.<br/>
Ear infection? Antiobiotics.
</p>

Solved:
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Homelessness</h3>
        As of 2022, Finland had 3,686 people experiencing homelessness, with only 492 spending the night outside, in a country of 5.5 million people.⁶<br/>
        How did they do this? "The country has adopted a Housing First policy, whereby social services assign homeless individuals rental homes first, and issues like mental health and substance abuse are treated second."⁷<br/>
        The problem with programs that try to get people clean and healthy before giving them housing, is that people in the situation of homelessness tend not to be in a state of mind, body, and life to successfully check boxes on someone's checklist.<br/>
        Pretty simple solution actually. The United States has 653,104 people experiencing homelessness.⁸<br/>
        Well over half a million, and a much higher per-capita rate, than Finland (and Sweden, etc.).<br/>
        Homeless people in The US also generally live in much more dangerous conditions than do homeless people in Finland.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Severe poverty</h3>
        Finland basically solved this too. Other countries, and sub-national social groups, have as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>"Poverty traps"</h3>
        The long-observed economic phenomenon of a spiraling into destitution that can happen below a certain level of wealth.⁹<br/>
        Your car broke down and you can't afford to fix it, so you can't drive to your job. Choosing between food and medicine.<br/> 
        Your problems compound. Finland.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Capitalism or Communism</h3>
        Finland again. Capitalism with a strong social safety net.<br/>
        Must we endlessly relitigate this?
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Mass incarceration, recidivism</h3>
        Finland
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Arguably the root of all of the above: unequal access to opportunity</h3>
        <p>
            Finland. No less than the_constitution of Finland makes it illegal to charge tuition for basic education (the definition of which includes college).¹⁰<br/>
            Finland has a small number of private schools, but they're funded exactly equally to public schools.<br/>
            In other words, every school is funded exactly equally.<br/>
            There are some very minor exceptions to this, such as foreign-language schools.¹¹<br/>
            No "school districts".<br/>
            The flip side of "I bought this expensive house to be in a good school district" is that other children have to be in bad school districts.<br/>
            In other words, generational poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is also no sorting of students by ability level, and no exams until the age of 18.<br/>
            There's many a story in the US about a student getting miscategorized early in life, as learning disabled, behaviorally-flawed, etc.<br/>
            There are many stories in which it wasn't even the student's ability or behavior, but rather secondary factors such as a teacher with a grudge, various forms of bigotry, and so on.<br/>
            Problem solved.<br/>
            Within a first approximation, everyone gets a shot.<br/>
            In my opinion, this should be the bare minimum.<br/>
            Not stifling ability, no forcing you into a specific job, no other relics of communism, but an equal shot.
        </p>
    </li>
<ul>

<p> 
Paradoxically, I see more spirited debate about the solved problems than the unsolved ones.<br/>
We'll accept reductive answers about childrearing ("don't spoil them"), but argue to the ends of the Earth about capitalism.
</p>

<p>
I think that attitude misses potential in both directions.<br/>
The unsolved problems are so much more interesting, and the solved problems are so much more important.
