### Solved and Unsolved

<p>
<b>
Some age-old problem are clearly unsolved.
Other age-old problems are clearly solved, yet their solutions are often ignored - often for psychological or cultural reasons.

Unsolved:
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Success in romantic relationships</h3>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Grappling with human mortality</h3>
        The inevitability of death. Finding meaning despite mortality.

        <h3>The Riemann hypothesis</h3>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Theodicy</h3>
        <p>"In the philosophy of religion, a theodicy is an argument that attempts to resolve the problem of evil that arises when omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and omniscience are all simultaneously ascribed to God." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodicy</p>

    <li>
        <h3>How to effectively raise children</h3>
        A balancing act. Give them everything: they turn out badly. Give them nothing: they turn out badly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Collatz Conjecture</h3>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>What "human nature" is</h3>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Relatedly: maybe human nature isn't always sunny: classism, general dualism, solipsism, the abuse of power, etc.</h3>
        Haven't fixed that one yet
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Affordable housing</h3>
        It's an asset class that everyone not just wants, but needs, the asset.
        In certain civilizations at least, the location in which one lives has a huge impact on all aspect of life: safety, education, etc.
        It's also a status symbol.
        Drive up the price
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Watchmaker Problem</h3>
        A watch is made by a watchmaker. The universe exists, so what created the universe?
        Why is there something rather than nothing? How could something come from nothing?
    </li>
<ul>

<p>
Unsolved isn't unsolvable though.
For example, it appears the weight-loss drug Ozempic can stop addictions across the board.
"People taking Ozempic for weight loss say they have also stopped drinking, smoking, shopping, and even nail biting." -https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/05/ozempic-addictive-behavior-drinking-smoking/674098/
I imagine it doesn't just simply cure all addictions, though. Nor does it act without side-effects.
And it took billions of dollars, plus the weight of centuries of human scientific knowledge, to achieve. 
</p>

<p>
Similarly, in the 1996 book by Ann Druyan and Carl Sagan "The Demon-Haunted World", it's pointed out that we could in fact get an answer to the Watchmaker Problem.
In particular, we could find out the universe is infinitely old: it has literally always existed. <TODO add citation within the book>
While not conformant with an everyday/commonsense worldview, that would indeed solve the problem.
And it's theoretically possible that that is indeed the actual answer.
For example, Roger Penrose - a 2020 Laureat of the Nobel Prize in Physics - has a theory called "Conformal cyclic cosmology", which holds that there have always been infinite cycles of big bangs and big crunches, literally forever.
The theory was popularized by Penrose's 2010 book "Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe".
Penrose claimed there is experimental evidence of infinite cycles of time, in rings present in the cosmic microwave background radiation. <TODO citation>
The theory, and experimental evidence, is not widely accepted by the scientific community.

A commonality I've noticed among proposed solutions to these problems is that they work if you're in a bubble.
That's for the ones that aren't simply scams or self-delusions, anyway.
Bubble-wise, most organized religions have answers to all of the above.
The answers tend to break down when the orthopraxy is questioned, however.
See what happened to Galileo.
Cycles of Time is a bubble, though a non-violent one.
</p>

<p>
I've long been fascinated with problems like Fermat's Last Theorem.
There's a gravity to a problem that was unsolved since being proposed in 1637.
Over 400 years. There's a timelessness to that. That's probably much of the appeal of tackling it.
I mention that by way of saying that I don't think the above problems are with irrelevant or trivial.
It's the gravitas of the aesthetic inherent in Fermat's Last Theorem that I think is missing.
In other words, epistemic humility: "maybe this is a lot harder than we thought".
</p>

<p>
This lens of thinking about things has helped me put the problems, and more critically, the proposed solutions one sees out there, in perspective.
Did some dude just, in the year 2024, finally figure out how to have harmonious romantic relationships?
Does it work if your partner has clinically diagnosed antisocial personality disorder (i.e. is literally a psychopath)? 
</p>

<p>
I think of these in contrast with problems that _are_ solved.<br/>
Ear infection? Antiobiotics.

Solved:
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Homelessness</h3>
        As of 2022, Finland had 3,686 people experiencing homelessness, with only 492 spending the night outside, in a country of 5.5 million people. -https://globalnews.ca/news/10198145/quebec-finland-successful-approach-homelessness-model.
        How did they do this? "The country has adopted a Housing First policy, whereby social services assign homeless individuals rental homes first, and issues like mental health and substance abuse are treated second." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_Finland
        The problem with programs that try to get people clean, healthy, etc. before giving them housing, is that people in the situation of homelessness tend to not be in a state of mind, body, and life to be able to complete a bunch of tasks.
        To check boxes. Pretty simple solution actually. The United States has 653,104 people experiencing homelessness.
        Well over half a million, and a much higher rate, and much more dangerous conditions, than Finland. -https://www.security.org/resources/homeless-statistics/
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Poverty in general</h3>
        Finland basically solved this too. Other countries, and sub-national social groups, have as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>"Poverty traps"</h3>
        The spiral into destitution that happens below a certain level of wealth.
        Being unable to afford a car repair, so you can't drive to your job. Your problems compound.
        Finland.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Capitalism or Communism</h3>
        Finland again. Definitely not communism. Capitalism with a strong welfare state.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Mass incarceration</h3>
        Finland
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Arguably the root of all of the above: unequal access to opportunity</h3>
        <p>
            Finland. No less than the _constitution_ of Finland makes it illegal to charge tuition for basic education (the definition of which includes college). -https://okm.fi/en/frequently-asked-questions
            Finland has a small number of private schools, but they're funded exactly equally to public schools.
            In other words, every school is funded exactly equally.
            There are some very minor exceptions to this, such as foreign-language schools, but they're not relevant to this discussion. -https://medium.com/@cailiansavage1/there-are-private-schools-in-finland-but-they-offer-the-same-education-based-on-the-national-4fe673d1b34a#:~:text=50-,%E2%80%9CThere%20are%20private%20schools%20in%20Finland%2C%20but%20they%20offer%20the,need%20government%20permission%20to%20operate.
            No "school districts".
            The flip side of "I bought this expensive house to be in a good school district" is the children in the bad school districts.
            In other words, generational poverty.

            There is also no sorting of students by ability level, and no exams until the age of 18.
            How many stories have you heard from the US about students getting miscategorized early in life, as learning disabled, behaviorally-flawed, etc.?
            There are many stories in which it wasn't even the student's ability or behavior, but rather secondary factors such as a teacher with a grudge, various forms of bigotry, and so on.
            Problem solved.
            Within a first approximation, everyone gets a shot.
            In my opinion, this should be the bare minimum.
            Not stifling ability or forcing you into a specific job or other relics of communism, but an equal shot.

Religions have solutions to the solved problems, too. The social and political malaises.
Solutions, however, are typically scoped to the appropriately-religious, tied to proselytism, or otherwise circumscribed.
They take care of the poor, health the addicted, and so on.
I'll say unironically that they often do better than the analogous secular systems.
</p>

<p> 
Paradoxically, I see more spirited debate about the solved problems than the unsolved ones.
We'll accept reductive answers for addiction ("it's a character flaw") or poverty ("laziness", "character flaw"), but argue to the ends of the Earth about mass incarceration.
</p>

<p>
I think that misses the mark in both directions. The unsolved problems are so much more interesting, and the solved problems are so much more important.

        Success in romantic relationships.
        If someone had figured this out, they'd probably have written it down and one could just implement the solution.

            <b>What "human nature" is.</b>
            This was often referenced in literature classes when I was in school.
            For example, it would be asserted that a piece of literature illuminated some aspect of human nature.
            But ok, what percent of human nature do we have figured out?
            Do we know the size of the problem?
            Has anyone made a serious attempt to stitch all these little illuminations together into the actual answer? "Here's human nature. It's a 20,000-page book, but once you read it, you know.".
            It doesn't seem an unreasonable ask.
            The analogous discovery and synthesis for calculus took place about 350 years ago. Hasn't changed since.
            I remember it was a point of pride for my high school calculus teacher that what he was teaching us was timeless, and you could say time-tested.

            There's a famous phrase, popularized by the German physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond: "Ignoramus et ignorabimus". It's Latin for "we do not know and will not know".
            That's the ethos I sensed in literature, and in art for that matter. A systemic lack of quantification.
            This may in part be due to what would happen if you asked the average artist or poet "what's 600 divided by 15?", but I think it runs deeper in the type of mind that gravitates toward the humanities and the arts.
        </p>
        <p>
            David Hilbert, the great German mathematician, said this at a famous address in 1930:
            "We must not believe those, who today, with philosophical bearing and deliberative tone, prophesy the fall of culture and accept the ignorabimus. For us there is no ignorabimus, and in my opinion none whatever in natural science. In opposition to the foolish ignorabimus our slogan shall be Wir müssen wissen – wir werden wissen ("We must know – we will know")."
        </p>
        <p>
            Just to bring in one more 18th-19th century German person, I'd hold up the works of Hermann Hesse as an example to actually illuminate the state space of human nature in way that's at once deeply moving, systematic, aspirationally comprehensive, and aspirationally compact.
            Siddartha, for example, is a fine example of "life, captured in book form".
            Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is another great example.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a shame that such books are often discounted, treated an unserious or as flimsy self-help nonsense.
            The following line from a New York Times book review of The Prophet has always stuck with me:
            "
            For those benighted few in Alfred Knopf's tight orbit, an encapsulation of "The Prophet" is in order. If you are in spiritual distress, if you wish to read a work in which life takes on the bittersweetness of a Chopin Ballade, in which the opalescent beauty of philosophy is miraculously pinned to the page, glistening like a Morpho butterfly - then by all means buy the collected works of Vladimir Nabokov. Of all the limp, mucid hooey now being sold without a prescription, "The Prophet" is the most blatant and outrageous. At its best, it is precisely what Huckleberry Finn called the King's speeches, "full of tears and flapdoodle." At its leakiest it is "Also Sprach Zarathustra" written in mauve icing on a cake of halvah.
            "

            In retrospect, it may largely be gatekeeping by the artsy types. CS Lewis' Inner Ring <link Inner Ring to the essay> concept is everywhere.
            Just like a lawyer wants to prolong a case to milk it for billable hours, so too the artsy folks may want to draw out to delineation of human nature, in furtherance of their sinectures around explaining it.
            And perhaps also, like the magician who does not reveal their secrets, they wish to keep the whole matter cloaked in an air of mystery and intrigue.
            The illumination of human nature then becomes an endeavor that only the initiated may attempt.
            And even they may only put a few measly little chisel marks in the unknowably vast edifice of "human nature", with their poems of plays or what-have-yous.

        How to sell stuff to people. Why isn't there one book on sales that you can read, that explains, accurately, how to sell stuff?
        You might say: but it depends on what stuff you're selling. Ok, then one book per significant category of thing to be sold.
        This is possible for linear algebra or physical chemistry, so it's not completely an unreasonable thought.

        <b>Mortality</b>
        Ernest Becker's thesis in his Pulizter Prize-winning book "The Denial of Death", is that "most human action is taken to ignore or avoid the inevitability of death". -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death
        If someone had figured out how to solve the fact every one of us will die, they'd be a trillionaire, and we'd all know about it.
        I mean solve it, too. Not halfway solve it: actually solve it, 100%. I'd consider a full solution to be either immortality, or zero negative emotion about death.
        The hydra, a small sea creature, is biologically immortal, dying only due to e.g. predation. Human immortality is possible, but obviously, hasn't happened.
        Likewise, if there were some philosophy or religion or thing one can do that solves death, I think it would have gotten written down, and we'd have heard about it by now.

        <b>The Watchmaker Problem</b>
        <p>Where did the universe come from? A watch has a maker, so must the universe have a maker. <add citation for the watchmaker problem> I have a degree in astronomy, including advanced coursework in cosmology, and "The Big Bang" isn't an actual answer to that question.
        The Big Bang just moves the problem. Nobody knows what caused the big bang, where the energy present at the start of the universe came from, where the laws of nature came from, or even what caused things like the cosmic inflation shortly after the Big Bang (different than the Big Bang itself).
        Scientists don't know, religious people don't know. Nobody knows. It remains a magnet for uninformed opinions though.</p>
