<p>
    I got interested in Bruce Lee in around 2008.
    Bruce Lee is so cool it was easy to get interested.
</p>

<p>
    In the summer of 2008, I bought one of his books, <i>Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i>.
    Jeet Kune Do is a martial art he invented.
</p>

<blockquote>
    Lee...based Jeet Kune Do upon his experiences in unarmed fighting and self defense, as well as upon his eclectic, Zen Buddhist, Confucianist and Taoist philosophies. 
</blockquote>

<p>
    -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeet_Kune_Do
</p>

<p>
    I skipped around in the book and didn't read it cover-to-cover. It was good.
</p>

<p>
More about Jeet Kune Do:<br/>
<blockquote>
As an eclectic martial art, it relies on a fighting style heavily influenced by Wing Chun, Tai Chi, taekwondo, boxing, fencing and jujutsu.

</blockquote> -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeet_Kune_Do

From Lee's wife, Linda Lee:<br/>
<blockquote>
<p>My husband Bruce always considered himself a martial artist first and an actor second. At the age of 13, Bruce started lessons in the wing chun style of gung-fu for the purpose of self-defense. Over the next 19 years, he transformed his knowledge into a science, an art, a philosophy and a way of life. He trained his body through exercise and practice; he trained his mind through reading and reflecting and he recorded his thoughts and ideas constantly over the 19 years. The pages of this book represent the pride of a life’s work.</p>

<p>In his lifelong quest for self-knowledge and personal expression, Bruce was constantly studying, analyzing and modifying all available relative information; his principle source was his personal library which consisted of over 2,000 books dealing with all forms of physical conditioning, martial arts, fighting techniques, defenses and related subjects.</p>

<p>
<i>Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i> has both philosophical abstractions and combat concretions, the latter including diagrams of physical stances and movements to use in combat.
For example:<br/>

<p>
<blockquote>
In 1970, Bruce sustained a rather severe injury to his back. His doctors ordered him to discontinue the practice of martial arts and to remain in bed to allow his back to heal. This was probably the most trying and dispiriting time in Bruce’s life. He stayed in bed, virtually flat on his back for six months, but he couldn't keep his mind from working — the result of which is this book.

I imagine it was particularly difficult for such a man of such physicality to be bedridden for so long.
It's much to his credit that he transformed that pain into a great work of literature.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of physicality, Lee was famous for great feats of strength, including his iconic two-finger push-ups.
Click the image to see them in action (video is 30 seconds and opens in a new tab):<br/>

</a>

Around when I read the book, inspired by Lee, I trained for thumbs-only push-ups:<br/>

</p>

<p>
    For a while during his youth, Lee was involved with street gangs.
    One time, during a gang-related conflict, he beat another young man so badly he knocked one of the guy's teeth out.
    The young man's parents complained to the police.
</p>

<p>
    Lee's mother had to pick Lee up from the police station.
    Later, Lee's father was warned by the police:<br/>
    <blockquote>
        The police detective came and said, "Excuse me, Mr. Lee, your son is really fighting bad in school. If he gets into just one more fight I might have to put him in jail".
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    After that episode, Lee exited gang life, turning his focus towards peaceful activities such as philosophy, art, and self-improvement.
    If I were to speculate, it was perhaps those early years of gang-affiliated life that built the fire behind his later accomplishments.
</p>

<p>
    The idea from Lee that's stayed with me the most is martial arts as a means of honestly expressing oneself.
    To quote Lee:
    <blockquote>
    to me, ultimately martial art means honestly expressing yourself
</blockquote>
-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2clpHtV1iA
</p>

<p>
    Lee succeeded in genuinely expressing himself.
    While best known for martial arts and films, he was expressive across many artistic media.
</p>

<p>
    Lee's Daughter Shannon Lee once said "He did write poetry; he was really the consummate artist." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee
    Lee acted in dozens of successful films, starting from early childhood.
    In family life as well, he built peace and positivity.
    He was a great family man, well-remembered by his wife and children, for example.
--TODO find sources for him being well-remembered by his wife, daughter, son, and/or any other family members that have spoken about the matter
</p>

<p>
    Returning to Lee's idea of martial arts as a means of honestly expressing oneself, I think <i>a lot of things are about honestly expressing oneself</i>.
</p>

<p>
    In French author Marcel Proust's 1,267,06-word novel, <i>In Search of Lost Time (À la recherche du temps perdu)</i>, published between 1913 and 1927, the narrator, a thinly disguised version of Proust himself, searches for "lost time".
    In other words, he tries to answer the question: can you reclaim the time you feel you've lost in life?
</p>

<p>
    It's a feeling many of us have experienced: years lost to bad decisions, distractions, and failures.
    Things could have gone differently and much better.
</p>

<p>
    After much searching, Proust's narrator comes to a perhaps surprising conclusion: the answer is <i>art</i>.
    In particular, the solution is to transmute the pain of lost time through using those experiences as the basis for creating works of art.
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
Returning to the prior circumstances of his life in order to translate them into a work of art is the means by which the Narrator reclaims the time lost in years gone by.
The Narrator comes to discover that time he thought wasted, in frivolous society or in love, now comes to represent the materials from which he will compose his art.
</blockquote>

That's perhaps the best idea I've ever encountered in literature.
</p>

<p>
Worth noting, however, is that that's what <i>a person of high integrity</i> does.
It's just as common to spend the rest of one's life being an angry resentful jerk on account of one's bad experiences in life.
More common, perhaps.
One can speculate that, just like the pain of being bedridden drove Lee to write <i>Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i>, so did the regret from an early life of gang activity result in the blossoming of creative beauty of Lee's subsequent life.

<p>
    We often settle for indirect self-expression.
    For example, we try to express ourselves through success in our careers or through our influence on our children.
    The problem is those thing don't give you full artistic expressivity, exacting artistic control, a guarantee that the art will be experienced by others, nor a short feedback cycle with your audience.
    Painting a painting then sharing it gives you all four.
</p>


"The book is dedicated to: The Free, Creative Martial Artist."

    He had a positive authenticity about him.
    In the interview with Pierre Berton referenced above, you can sort of feel Berton appreciating Lee's authenticity, and showing Lee authenticity and respect in return.
    --TODO: watch the full interview, and add a link to the full interview, which is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk1lzkH-e4U
</p>

<p>
    Lee is a fine example of the confluence of philosophical ideation and concrete implementation.
    In ideation, he took formal coursework in philosophy at the University of Washington, and studied various intellectual topics in a wide-ranging manner on his own.
    In implementation, he put those ideas into practice as art: films, poetry, books, and martial arts.
</p>

<p>
    A commonality between philosophy and combat is essentialism.
    A street fight gets to some core aspects of human, and even animal, nature.
    A punch in the face is timeless, and, shall we say, unambiguous.
</p>

Likewise, if you continually click the first link on Wikipedia, you almost always eventually end up on the page for philosophy, no matter where you start.
And if you continue the process outward from the article for philosophy, you eventually end up ```````````````````````````````back at the article for philosophy.
See this for a fascinating explanation of the "Wikipedia link rule" about philosophy: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-llumS2rA8I)
</p>

<p>
Philosophy is a Greek word meaning "love of knowledge" or "love of wisdom". -https://www.etymonline.com/word/philosophy
It's the only field of study whose name itself speaks to love. -- TODO validate that that's true
An end onto itself, done out of love.
</p>

<p>
Bruce Lee understood the essential importance of family.
by all accounts he had great relationships with both his wife son and both of them remember him fondly and speak well of him.
</p>

Wiki for Jeet Kune Do: Jeet Kune Do, which Lee intended to have practical applications in life without the traditional routines and metaphysics of conventional martial arts, also incorporates a set of principles to help practitioners make quick decisions and improve their mental and physical health.

In other words you study or practice all the other subjects because they have some instrumental value, such as chemistry has an instrumental value,
And well you may find or discover a love of chemistry it's perhaps actually philosophy that you're discovering with in chemistry and what you really love is the knowledge or the wisdom that you see in a way through a lens of love in chemistry.
But philosophy is entirely about the love of knowledge or wisdom.

<p>
    This gets to a core idea of why we tend to admire people: those who have power but don't abuse it.
    Any schmoe can be peaceful. It's different when someone turns from violence to peace, especially when they're still quite capable of violence.
