<p>
    I got interested in Bruce Lee in around 2008.
    Honestly Bruce Lee is so cool it was easy to get interested.
</p>

<p>
    In the summer of 2008, I bought one of his books, <i>Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i>.
    Kindof skipped around in the book and didn't read it cover-to-cover.
    It was good though.
</p>

TODO: quote from the introduction here: https://ia601308.us.archive.org/16/items/pdfy-SP1dBDr6xLGrVfF9/Tao%20Of%20Jeet%20Kune%20Do.pdf

<p>
Jeet Kune Do is Lee's own martial art and philosophy, created out of his learnings and practical experiments in martial arts.
--TODO: add the note here about the other martial arts and/or ideas that influenced Jeet Kune Do
Tao of Jeet Kune Do has both philosophical abstractions and combat concretions, such as diagrams of physical stances and movements to use in combat.
TODO: add an example of such a diagram, which I had in my book review on Facebook
</p>

<p>
    It's apparently the best-selling martial arts book in the world:
    <blockquote>
    Compiled from Bruce Lee's notes and essays and originally published in 1975, Tao of Jeet Kune Do is the best-selling martial arts book in the world
    </blockquote>

Around that time, inspired by Bruce Lee, I trained for fingertips-only push-ups ðŸ˜Ž:

<p>
The idea of Lee's that's stayed with me the most is martial arts as a means of honestly expressing oneself.
To quote Lee:
<blockquote>
to me, ultimately martial art means honestly expressing yourself
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Proustâ€™s work is distinctively his own, but at the same time it makes visible the
conflicting mentalities that bridged the mechanization of slaughter in WWI. His work
encapsulates a range of reactions to nostalgia for a better historical moment, as well as nostalgia
for a different experience of time itself â€“ as fulfilled and meaningful, rather than the site of
incomprehensible losses. Proustâ€™s lesson is that art must replace god as the force that answers our
fundamental human problems. Our wanting must take the form of desire, because only desire
allows the artist to fully subsume his object in the pursuit of a mode of representation that can
respond to the terror of dying. Proustâ€™s work experiments with the precariousness of love, but
finds it intolerable â€“ the border that enables loveâ€™s joy yawns too darkly with the inevitable
death. Although Proustâ€™s friendships and his reactions to contemporary political events indicate
that he privileged trust and human kindness in his life, how his aesthetic conclusions belie the
same desirous nostalgic force that drove the history of the 20th century.

<p>
    Lee succeeded wonderfully in genuinely expressing himself.
    He had a positive authenticity about him.
    In the interview with Pierre Berton referenced above, you can sort of feel Berton appreciating Lee's authenticity, and showing Lee authenticity and respect in return.
    --TODO: watch the full interview, and add a link to the full interview, which is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk1lzkH-e4U
</p>

<p>
    Lee is a fine example of the confluence of philosophical ideation and concrete implementation.
    In ideation, he took formal coursework in philosophy at the University of Washington, and studied various intellectual topics in a wide-ranging manner on his own.
    In implementation, he put those ideas into practice as art: films, poetry, books, and martial arts.
</p>

<p>
While best known for martial arts and films, Lee was expressive in many media.

His Daughter Shannon Lee once said "He did write poetry; he was really the consummate artist." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee
He acted in dozens of successful films, starting from early childhood, yet avoided the typical curse of childhood stardom.
He was a serious practical combat fighter and a great family man - well-remembered by his wife, for example.
--TODO find sources for him being well-remembered by his wife, daughter, son, and/or any other family members that have spoken about the matter
</p>

<p>
As a fighter, he was a boxing champion in Hong Kong as a young man.
For a while during his youth, he became involved in gang-related conflicts.
As part of one such conflict, he beat another young man so badly in a street fight that he knocked one of the guy's teeth out.
That led the young man's parent to complain to the police.
</p>

<p>
    Lee's mother had to pick him up from the police station.
    Later, Lee's father was warned by the police:
    <blockquote>
        The police detective came and said, "Excuse me, Mr. Lee, your son is really fighting bad in school. If he gets into just one more fight I might have to put him in jail".
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    However, Lee exited the gang life, and street fighting, turning his focus instead towards peace-building activities such as philosophy, art, and self-improvement.
    This goes back to the idea of honestly expressing oneself.
    If I were to speculate, it was perhaps those early years of gang-affiliated life - at odds with society - that built the fire in Lee that drove the accomplishments of the rest of his life.
    A good person realizes their mistakes and course-corrects with great force.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Coming back to Lee's idea of martial arts as a means of honestly expressing oneself, I think <i>a lot of things in life are about honestly expressing oneself</i>.</b>
    TODO: look up the studies and rework this: Dr. Gabor MatÃ© has popularized the scientific discovery that women who express themselves, and especially, who express their anger when they experience anger, are both less likely to contract breast cancer and more likely to survive breast cancer if they do contract it.
</p>

<p>
    I sometimes ask people, "are you doing any kind of creative self-expression?".
    The question often catches people off-guard, rather like "are you happy?".
</p>

<p>
    I don't ask it with negative intent, though.
    Creative self-expression is like a vitamin deficiency.
    Like tasting a forkful of nicely-cooked spinach, you just feel better when you have it.
</p>

<p>
    We often settle for indirect self-expression.
    For example, self-expression via success in our careers or via our influence on our children.
    The problem is those thing don't give you full artistic expressivity, exacting artistic control, a guarantee of the art will be experienced by others, nor a short feedback cycle with your audience.
    Painting a painting then sharing it gives you all four.
</p>

<p>
    In Marcel Proust's 1,267,06-word novel, <i>In Search of Lost Time (Ã€ la recherche du temps perdu)</i>, published between 1913 and 1927, the narrator, a thinly disguised alias of Proust himself, searches for the meaning of life...with perhaps an oddly specific definition of "the meaning of life".
    The definition is, as per the title of the novel (<i>In Search of Lost Time</i>), how can you reclaim lost time?
</p>

<p>
    It's a feeling many of us have experienced: years lost to bad decisions, distractions, failures.
    We feel things could have gone so differently, so much better.
</p>

<p>
    After much searching, Proust's narrator comes to a perhaps surprising solution to this problem: the answer is <i>art</i>.
    In particular, the idea that one can transmute the pain of lost time through using those experiences as the basis for creating works of art.
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
"Returning to the prior circumstances of his life in order to translate them into a work of art is the means by which the Narrator reclaims the time lost in years gone by.
The Narrator comes to discover that time he thought wasted, in frivolous society or in love, now comes to represent the materials from which he will compose his art."
</blockquote>

This is perhaps the single best idea I've ever encountered in literature.
</p>

<p>
Proust's idea reminds me of something my father, Denis Culley, who was an English (literature) major in college, used to tell me: <i>"the first word every author puts to the page is "pain"."</i>

</p>

<p>
    A commonality between philosophy and combat is essentialism.
    A street fight gets to some core aspects of human, and even animal, nature.
    A punch in the face is timeless, and, shall we say, unambiguous.
</p>

Likewise, if you continually click the first link on Wikipedia, you almost always eventually end up on the page for philosophy, no matter where you start.
And if you continue the process outward from the article for philosophy, you eventually end up ```````````````````````````````back at the article for philosophy.
See this for a fascinating explanation of the "Wikipedia link rule" about philosophy: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-llumS2rA8I)
</p>

<p>
Philosophy is a Greek word meaning "love of knowledge" or "love of wisdom". -https://www.etymonline.com/word/philosophy
It's the only field of study whose name itself speaks to love. -- TODO validate that that's true
An end onto itself, done out of love.
</p>

<p>
Bruce Lee understood the essential importance of family.
by all accounts he had great relationships with both his wife son and both of them remember him fondly and speak well of him.
</p>

<p>
This photo of Bruce Lee in his casket that has really stayed with me: TODO add photo (https://i0.wp.com/.../2015/11/Brucelee11-Khurki.net_.jpg...).
All of that ambition and discipline and drive and talent and energy and character were permanently and simply gone, without reason.
</p>

<p>
I once heard someone say, speaking of mind uploading, that in the future we'll look back at the current era with astonishment.
In this era which we carried around something as precious as our entire mind in this biological vessel - subject to innumerable risks of complete loss.
We do better with our hard drives.
</p>

<p>
Nonexistence is perhaps especially incongruous and inexplicable when someone young dies so suddenly. 
Even more so when they're a great person, like Bruce Lee. 
Oumou Sangare has a song title that captures this well: [Saa Magna - "Death is Terrible"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_YyroDeZrY).
</p>

<p>
Rather than focus on the tragedy of his early death, perhaps it's best to focus on how thoughtful, deep, and self-disciplined he was â€” to be able to identify, and so profoundly fulfill, such essential aspects of life within his short time on this planet.

In other words you study or practice all the other subjects because they have some instrumental value, such as chemistry has an instrumental value,
And well you may find or discover a love of chemistry it's perhaps actually philosophy that you're discovering with in chemistry and what you really love is the knowledge or the wisdom that you see in a way through a lens of love in chemistry.
But philosophy is entirely about the love of knowledge or wisdom.


<p>
    This gets to a core idea of why we tend to admire people: those who have power but don't abuse it.
    Any schmoe can be peaceful. It's different when someone turns from violence to peace, especially when they're still quite capable of violence.
