<p>I used to work in Hamilton, New Jersey, a town not far from Princeton, New Jersey.
Princeton is a nice town. Nice to walk around in, nice restaurants, nice old timey academic buildings.
The architectural branding theme is stone of various hues, mostly brown and grey. Marble and slate.
It's quite beautiful. Have a look:

A favored activity when I'd drive over to Princeton was to go by John von Neumann's former home.
Here it is, 26 Westcott Road:

Year ago, in the introduction to a college textbook on Buddhism for a course I took,
there was a description of a person (a historian/academic as I recall) looking at a Buddha statue
and saying here, among the thousands of years of very checkered human history, is an idealogy (Buddhism)
that's unequivocally something to be proud of as a species.
In a world largely centered on negativity, I feel similarly about von Neumann's worldview and achievements: his life and work, both personal and professional.

add in:
the piece about the tone, intimacy, and candor of his letters when he spoke to Gödel, versus when he spoke to everyone else,
including world-famous academics and Navy Commodore Louis L Strauss.
The difference, perhaps, between a friendly acquaintance and a good friend.
Visiting an acquaintance, you come into the house, stand semi-awkwardly in the foyer, then follow them, again semi-awkwardly,
to the kitchen or living room.
With a good friend, you come in and plop yourself, Fosbury-esque, onto the couch.

In the study of character, it's interesting to think of how he tackled both such gritty real-world problems as nuclear war, yet made space in his imagination for such fantastical, and in a sense wondrous, ideas as self-replicating interplanetary probes.
Those probes are

Dr. John von Neumann was born Neumann János Lajos, on December 28, 1903 in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary.
He accomplished a great deal in his life, including the exceedingly rare combination of seminal scientific discovery across multiple disciplines alongside deeply influential work in geopolitics and the military. 

When I think of Professor John von Neumann I am reminded of a reference I once read, to a description by Dante of a mind "on fire with the truth".

He can't be characterized monofactorially, yet this description from a review of _Selected Letters_ is apt:

> The unifying theme in von Neumann’s life and
    work—abundantly demonstrated by his correspondence—was an insatiable urge to be absorbing
    information and solving problems all the time.
    "Johnny’s most characteristic trait was his boundless curiosity about everything and anything, his
    compulsive ambition to know, to understand any
    problem, no matter on what level,” wrote Klari after
    his death. "Anything that would tickle his curiosity
    with a question mark, he could not leave alone;
    he would sulk, pout, and be generally impossible
    until, at least to his own satisfaction, he had found
    the right answer.
-https://www.ams.org/notices/200706/tx070600724p.pdf

Major themes of his life include mathematics, computing, physics, politics, and the military.

<p>In each of those, he was world-changingly successful.</p>

<p>In mathematics, he founded multiple entirely new fields, including, most notably, being the founder of game theory.</p>

<p>In politics and military work, he did critical work on the Manhattan project.
He was instrumental in, it would not be hyperbolic to say, saving the world.</p>

<p>In computing, he invented the internal organizational architecture that is still used by most computers today.
It is called, straightforwardly, "The von Neumann Architecture".
To quote, "The Von Neumann architecture consists of a single, shared memory for programs and data, a single bus for memory access, an arithmetic unit, and a program control unit."
-https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/von-neumann-architecture</p>

<p>He invented this architecture in 1945.
As if that were not enough, his reason for doing all this was a combination of saving the world (The Manhattan Project) and (successfully) pioneering artificial intelligence.
1945!</p>

<p>Personality-wise, he was social and boisterous.
He loved parties, and he loved loud music.

> "[He] did some of his best work in noisy, chaotic environments, including with his wife's phonograph playing loudly".
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann

> "[He] could attend parties until the early hours of the morning and then deliver a lucid lecture at 8:30.".
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann
</p>

<p>He was a great leader, in academic contexts as well as in military contexts.

> "Many considered him an excellent chairman of committees, deferring rather easily on personal or organizational matters but pressing on technical ones."
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann

Editorial aside: that does sound like the kind of leader you'd want. Low-ego: put the personal stuff aside and focus on the problems at hand
Further editorial aside: this is a fairly standard mode of communication in STEM fields.
I've heard it phrased as something like "everyone gets around the table, metaphorically puts the problem on the table and metaphorically kind of pushes it around."
Egos, and arguments from authority being, at least aspirationally, removed. Best idea wins.
Politicians, journalists, and others could perhaps benefit herein.</p>

<p>He was a good husband and father, yet was once divorced.
His daughter, Marina von Neumann Whitman, wrote a memoir in 2012, titled "The Martian's Daughter: A Memoir": https://www.amazon.com/Martians-Daughter-Memoir-Marina-Whitman/dp/0472035649
Marina is, like her father was, intellectually brilliant and highly successful.
Top of her class at Radcliff (now Harvard), PhD from Colombia, successful industry executive, served as a presidential economic advisor, and since 1973 has been a Distinguished Public Service Professor of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh.
In her memoir, she speaks highly of her father, who by all accounts was about as good and as supportive of a father as one could hope for.</p> 

<p>Johnny was ethnically and culturally Jewish.
He was, however, more or less agnostic.
On his deathbed, he literally opted for Pascal's Wager.
Logically-minded to the end, he said " "So long as there is the possibility of eternal damnation for nonbelievers it is more logical to be a believer at the end."
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann</p>

<p>He escaped Hungary before The Holocaust. Defeating Nazism was, unsurprisingly, a deep and personal mission.</p>

<p>He also saw firsthand the effects of Soviet-era communism kickin' off next door.
Ukraine, which borders Hungary, joined the USSR in 1922 while he was still living in Hungary.
In fact, nearly all the Union Republics of the Soviet Union had joined the USSR by the time von Neumann left for America in 1930 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union).

> "During a Senate committee hearing he described his political ideology as 'violently anti-communist, and much more militaristic than the norm'"
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann

> "Von Neumann entered government service primarily because he felt that, if freedom and civilization were to survive, it would have to be because the United States would triumph over totalitarianism from Nazism, Fascism and Soviet Communism"
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann
</p>

<p>He was conscientious in almost all areas of his life, yet was arrested multiple times for reckless driving (including for reading a book while driving).
Driving was apparently too boring.
One is reminded of Richard Feynman's last words: "I'd hate to die twice. It's so boring." ([[]])</p>

<p>At 15 years old, he so deeply impressed mathematician Gábor Szegő with his mathematical abilities that Szegő wept literal tears of joy.</p>

<p>I think it's really the confluence of factors that that make the whole picture of von Neumann so fascinating.
What would the world be like if we had more von Neumanns, or all von Neumanns? Better, worse, unimaginably different?

------------------------------------------
From the book:

> "Throughout much of his career, he led a double life: as an intellectual leader in the ivory tower of pure mathematics and as a man of action, in constant demand as an advisor, consultant and decision-maker to what is sometimes called the military-industrial complex of the United States. My own belief is that these two aspects of his double life, his wide-ranging activities as well as his strictly intellectual pursuits, were motivated by two profound convictions. The first was the overriding responsibility that each of us has to make full use of whatever intellectual capabilities we were endowed with. He had the scientist's passion for learning and discovery for its own sake and the genius's ego-driven concern for the significance and durability of his own contributions. The second was the critical importance of an environment of political freedom for the pursuit of the first, and for the welfare of mankind in general.
I'm convinced, in fact, that all his involvements with the halls of power were driven by his sense of the fragility of that freedom. By the beginning of the 1930s, if not even earlier, he became convinced that the lights of civilization would be snuffed out all over Europe by the spread of totalitarianism from the right: Nazism and Fascism. So he made an unequivocal commitment to his home in the new world and to fight to preserve and reestablish freedom from that new beachhead.
In the 1940s and 1950s, he was equally convinced that the threat to civilization now came from totalitarianism on the left, that is, Soviet Communism, and his commitment was just as unequivocal to fighting it with whatever weapons lay at hand, scientific and economic as well as military. It was a matter of utter indifference to him, I believe, whether the threat came from the right or from the left. What motivated both his intense involvement in the issues of the day and his uncompromisingly hardline attitude was his belief in the overriding importance of political freedom, his strong sense of its continuing fragility, and his conviction that it was in the United States, and the passionate defense of the United States, that its best hope lay."

-Professor Marina von Neumann Whitman, economist and Johnny's daughter. Pages xv–xvi.

-von Neumann's prewar thoughts on World War II

------------------------------------------

> "To conclude, I would like to mention that the importance of accelerating approximating and computing mathematics by factors like 10,000 or more, lies not only in that one might thereby do in 10,000 times less time problems which one is now doing, or say 100 times more of them in 100 times less time, - but rather in that one will be able to handle problems which are considered completely unassailable at present.
I need not tell you that I shall be very gladly at your disposal at any time when you want more specific details about this subject"

-von Neumann to Commodore Louis L Strauss, on a proposal to build a computer in *1945*, page 236. I believe this computer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAS_machine. I wonder what he'd think of ChatGPT.

------------------------------------------

> "In principle, he reasoned, there was no reason why some day a machine might not be built which not only could perform most of the functions of the human brain but could actually reproduce itself, i.e., create more supermachines like it. He proposed to present this paper at Yale, where he had been invited to give the 1956 Silliman Lectures."

-Clay Bair Jr., in Life Magazine, 25 February 1957

That's von Neumann on artificial general intelligence and even AI takeoff/intelligence explosion/AI superintelligence, in *1956*!

------------------------------------------

I read somewhere that von Neumann developed early computers actually specifically with the goal of building artificial general intelligence. He was thinking about these things in the 1930s; discussing them with Alan Turing, for example. And he was working on them hands-on, via machines such as EDVAC, ENIAC, and the IAS machine, in the 1940s.

> "The first use of the concept of a singularity in the technological context is attributed to von Neumann, who according to [Stanisław] Ulam discussed the "ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue."
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann

The notes for the Silliman Lectures form the basis for Neumann's final book: The Computer and the Brain: https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Brain.../dp/0300181116.

<p>In 1955, a tumor was discovered near von Neumann's collarbone. 
Cancer was also found elsewhere in his body.
In the spring of 1956, he checked into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as a cancer patient
He continued to work from his hospital room, including consulting with top military officials.  (https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1998-99/game-theory/neumann.html).</p>

<p>von Neumann took with him to Walter Reed the manuscript he was preparing for the Silliman Lectures.
It was his singular focus during his final days.
It was during that hospital visit at Walter Reed that he ultimately passed away, from bone cancer, in early 1957.
Rest in peace Dr. von Neumann. We have the watch.
