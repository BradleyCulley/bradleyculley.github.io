<p>
<b>When I think of Dr. John von Neumann, I am reminded of a reference I once read, to a description by Dante of a mind _"on fire with the truth"_.</b>
</p>

<b>Early Life and Education</b>

<p>

> "Von Neumann was born in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary...on December 28, 1903, to a wealthy, acculturated, and non-observant Jewish family.
    His Hungarian birth name was Neumann János Lajos.
    In Hungarian, the family name comes first, and his given names are equivalent to John Louis in English."

> "Von Neumann was a child prodigy who at six years old could divide two eight-digit numbers in his head and could converse in Ancient Greek."

[[include photos from here of a young JVN: https://www.privatdozent.co/p/the-unparalleled-genius-of-john-von-beb]]

<p>At 15 years old, von Neumann so deeply impressed mathematician Gábor Szegő with his (von Neumann's) mathematical abilities that Szegő wept literal tears of joy.⁷</p>

<p>

"By the age of 19, von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, which superseded Georg Cantor's definition."¹
You know you're doing ok when you're beating Georg Cantor at his own game..

</p>

<p>
For his university schooling, he undertook, simultaneously, a degree in chemical engineering from ETH Zurich and a PhD in mathematics from Pázmány Péter University in Budapest.
The chemical engineering degree was undertaken under the advice of his father, a pragmatically-minded banker.
It wasn't the typical parental pressure situation though.
von Neumann and his father kind of thought through options and together decided on chemical engineering.
von Neumann appears to have dodged the whole "do what makes money or do what I'm passionate about" situation by simply doing both.
He completed both degrees in 1926. He received his PhD Summa Cum Laude, with minors in experimental physics and chemistry.
He then completed his Habilitation, which like a European version of a postdoc, thereby qualifying himself to be a university professor.
</p>

<b>Professional Life</b>
<p>
    After his schooling, he became a "Privatdozent" at the University of Berlin.
    A Privatdozent is kind of like a lecturer/professor.
    He was "the youngest person ever elected Privatdozent in the university's history in any subject"¹ at the University.
    "He [then] began writing nearly one major mathematics paper per month."¹.
</p>

<p>
von Neumann worked for a few years as a lecturer for universities in Germany, then took a role as a visiting lecturer at Princeton University.
Shortly afterward, he accepted a position as a tenured professor at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton.
He remained a professor at the IAS for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>
The IAS is an interesting institution. 
"[The] guiding principle in founding the institute was the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.
The faculty have no classes to teach.
There are no degree programs or experimental facilities at the institute.
Research is never contracted or directed.
It is left to each individual researcher to pursue their own goals."
von Neumann 
</p>

<p>
A not-so-well-known fact about the IAS in Princeton is that it's not actually part of Princeton University.
While there are collaborations and programs that informally link the two, it's a completely separate institution.
A kind of fun fact about the IAS is that it was just created "out of nowhere" from scratch with funding from a brother and sister - Louis Bamberger and Caroline Bamberger Fuld - who owned a department store in Newark, NJ.
The store was called "Bamberger's".
</p>


<p>
His memory was best described as prodigious. It's probably the case that his is the best memory of anyone who has ever lived, at least about whom there is a historical record.
Brian Bi makes this claim elegantly: [[insert Brian Bi quote from Quora]]] 

> Von Neumann was also noted for his eidetic memory, particularly of the symbolic kind. Herman Goldstine writes:
 One of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall. As far as I could tell, von Neumann was able on once reading a book or article to quote it back verbatim; moreover, he could do it years later without hesitation.
 He could also translate it at no diminution in speed from its original language into English.
 On one occasion I tested his ability by asking him to tell me how A Tale of Two Cities started. Whereupon, without any pause, he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes.
 Von Neumann was reportedly able to memorize the pages of telephone directories.
 He entertained friends by asking them to randomly call out page numbers; he then recited the names, addresses and numbers therein¹
</p>

<p>
"He knew Hungarian, French, German and English fluently, and maintained a conversational level of Italian, Yiddish, Latin and Ancient Greek. His Spanish was less perfect"¹
</p>

<p>
"A Princeton professor of [Byzantine History] once stated that by the time he was in his thirties, Johnny had greater expertise in Byzantine history than he did (Blair, 1957).
</p>

"You know, Herb, Johnny can do calculations in his head ten times as fast as I can. And I can do them ten times as fast as you can, so you can see how impressive Johnny is" 
-Enrico Fermi (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1938)¹⁷

"One had the impression of a perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch."
-Eugene Wigner (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1963)¹⁷

"There was a seminar for advanced students in Zürich that I was teaching and von Neumann was in the class. I came to a certain theorem, and I said it is not proved and it may be difficult. von Neumann didn’t say anything but after five minutes he raised his hand. When I called on him he went to the blackboard and proceeded to write down the proof. After that I was afraid of von Neumann"
-George Pólya¹⁷

<p>
He accomplished an almost unbelievable amount in his life. Seminal scientific discoveries across multiple disciplines as well as deeply influential work in geopolitics and with the military.
A rare combination indeed. Typically two different types of minds for two different roles.
</p>

<p>
von Neumann can't be characterized monofactorially, yet this description from a review of _Selected Letters_ is apt:
</p>

<p>

> The unifying theme in von Neumann’s life and
work—abundantly demonstrated by his correspondence—was an insatiable urge to be absorbing
information and solving problems all the time.
"Johnny’s most characteristic trait was his boundless curiosity about everything and anything, his
compulsive ambition to know, to understand any
problem, no matter on what level,” wrote Klari [von Neumann's wife] after
his death. "Anything that would tickle his curiosity
with a question mark, he could not leave alone;
he would sulk, pout, and be generally impossible
until, at least to his own satisfaction, he had found
the right answer.²

</p>

Major themes of his life include mathematics, politics and the military, physics, computing.

<p>In each of those, he was world-changingly successful.</p>

<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p>He founded multiple entirely new fields, including, most notably, game theory.
von Neumann was the sole founder of the mathematical field of game theory, via his 1928 paper "Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele" ("On the Theory of Games of Strategy", https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01448847).
"In his 20s, he revolutionized set theory, ergodic theory and continuous geometry — all major disciplines of theoretical mathematics."¹³
</p>

<h3>In politics and the military</h3>
<p>
He did critical work on the Manhattan project.
Von Neumann became a leading authority on the mathematics of shaped charges, explosive charges shaped to focus the effect of the energy of an explosive. He was instrumental in the design of the second atomic bomb...¹³
He was instrumental in - it would not be hyperbole to say - saving the world.
</p>

<h3>Physics</h3>
<p>
"Von Neumann published a set of papers which established a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics."¹³
</p>

<h3>Computing</h3>
<p>
He invented the internal organizational architecture that is still used in almost all computers today.
It is called, straightforwardly, "The von Neumann Architecture".
To quote, "The Von Neumann architecture consists of a single, shared memory for programs and data, a single bus for memory access, an arithmetic unit, and a program control unit."¹¹
</p>

<p>
He invented this architecture in 1945.
As if that were not enough, his reason for working on computing was a combination of wanting to save the world (The Manhattan Project) and wanting to pioneer artificial intelligence.
He was successful in both regards. 1945!
</p>

<p>
"He created the field of cellular automata through his rigorous mathematical treatment of the structure of self-replication, which preceded the discovery of DNA by several years."¹³
Cellular automata are sufficiently important computational structures as to be a standard part of university-level computer science curricula. 
Von Neumann proposed the concept of a "learning machine" that could improve its performance over time by learning from its experiences, which led to machine learning.¹³
</p>

<p>
"About the 75th most impressive thing von Neumann did was create open-source computing. Some of the early computing vendors he consulted to attempted to make his architectural innovations proprietary. He fought back legally and won in a three-year federal trial, creating the industry precedent that core IT innovations belonged to society, not individual firms.¹³
</p>

<p>
He invented the concept of a technological singularity. A topic on all our minds these days.
"The first person to use the concept of a "singularity" in the technological context was the 20th-century Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann. Stanislaw Ulam reports in 1958 an earlier discussion with von Neumann "centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint."¹⁸
It must be stressed, he came up with this idea _before the mid 1950s_.

<p>
His many other professional contributions include the fruits of his informal collaborations and discussions with other luminaries, as well as his classified military work, including on the Manhattan project
</p>

<p>
Personality-wise, he was social and boisterous.
Contrast that with Kurt Gödel awkwardly telling the judge in his citizenship hearing that he'd found a constitutional loophole that could let The United States become a dictatorship ([Gödel's Loophole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_Loophole)).
von Neumann loved parties, loud music, and off-color jokes.
He was a fun dude to hang out with.
</p>

<p>
I read somewhere that America suited him far better than it did most of the other intellectual luminaries who fled Europe around the time of WWII.
It's a apt point.
He was an extremely patriotic American. A case in point: "Von Neumann became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1937, and immediately tried to become a lieutenant in the U.S. Army's Officers Reserve Corps. He passed the exams but was rejected because of his age."¹
Note that lieutenant is the lowest rank among officers.
He was a world-famous mathematician, ready to go through boot camp to join the Army at the very bottom of the hierarchy. And he was serious about it. 
But that's just one dimension in which he fit in well in America.  
He was serious about his work, yet lighthearted and playful outside of work.
He had a folksy sense of human: "Quite independently of his liking for abstract wit, he had a strong appreciation (one might say almost a hunger) for the more earthy type of comedy and humor".
He was boisterous and gregarious. He lived in a big, and fairly fancy, house. Have a look:<br/><br/>

</p>

<p>
He threw parties. May have grilled a burger or two.
He was militaristic. He participated in and grew the military industrial complex.
Contrast that with Einstein's atom bomb regrets. 
von Neumann believed in the power of technology, and of invention. He was a futurist.
He had a taste for power and influence, yet wielded both in a low-key sort of folksy manner.
Conversely, he suited America well. He helped America win WWII and, via pioneering work on ICBMs, to be positioned to win the Cold War.
He contributed greatly to American scholarship and to many American institutions.
Near the end of his life, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Dwight Eisenhower.
Doesn't get much more "well-suited" than the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
</p>

<p>

> "[He] did some of his best work in noisy, chaotic environments, including with his wife's phonograph playing loudly".¹

> "[He] could attend parties until the early hours of the morning and then deliver a lucid lecture at 8:30.".¹
</p>

<p>He was a great leader, in both academic and military contexts.

> "Many considered him an excellent chairman of committees, deferring rather easily on personal or organizational matters but pressing on technical ones."¹
</p>

<p>He was a good husband and father, yet was once divorced.
His daughter, Marina von Neumann Whitman, wrote a memoir in 2012, titled "The Martian's Daughter: A Memoir": https://www.amazon.com/Martians-Daughter-Memoir-Marina-Whitman/dp/0472035649.
The term "Martian" comes via Leo Szilard, himself most famous for conceiving the nuclear chain reaction (a.k.a. nuclear weapons), who was himself Hungarian.¹⁵
"The Martians" (Hungarian: "A marslakók") is a term used to refer to a group of prominent Hungarian scientists (mostly, but not exclusively, physicists and mathematicians) of Jewish descent who emigrated from Europe to the United States in the early half of the 20th century."¹⁵</p>

<p>Marina is, like her father was, intellectually brilliant and highly successful.
Top of her class at Radcliff (now Harvard), PhD from Colombia, successful industry executive, served as a presidential economic advisor, and since 1973 has been a Distinguished Public Service Professor of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh.⁹
"[Marina] wrote that he was very concerned with his legacy in two aspects: her life and the durability of his intellectual contributions to the world."¹
In her memoir, she speaks highly of her father, who by all accounts was about as good and as supportive of a father as one could hope for.
</p> 

<p>von Neumann was ethnically and culturally Jewish.
He was, however, more or less religiously agnostic.
One could say he was one of long line of areligious jewish intellectual titans.
On his deathbed, he literally opted for Pascal's Wager.
Logically-minded to the end, he said "So long as there is the possibility of eternal damnation for nonbelievers it is more logical to be a believer at the end."
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann</p>

<p>He escaped Hungary before The Holocaust. Defeating Nazism was a deeply personal mission.</p>

<p>He also saw firsthand the effects of Soviet-era communism kickin' off right next door.
Ukraine, which borders Hungary, joined the USSR in 1922 while he was still living in Hungary.
In fact, nearly all the Union Republics of the Soviet Union had joined the USSR by the time von Neumann left for America in 1930 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union).

> "During a Senate committee hearing he described his political ideology as 'violently anti-communist, and much more militaristic than the norm'"
> -¹

> "Von Neumann entered government service primarily because he felt that, if freedom and civilization were to survive, it would have to be because the United States would triumph over totalitarianism from Nazism, Fascism and Soviet Communism"
> -¹
</p>

<p>He was conscientious in almost all areas of his life, yet was arrested multiple times for reckless driving (including for reading a book while driving).
Driving was apparently too boring.
One is reminded of Richard Feynman's famous last words: "I'd hate to die twice. It's so boring." ([[]])</p>

<p>I think it's the confluence of factors that make the picture of von Neumann so fascinating.
What would the world be like if we had more von Neumanns, or all von Neumanns? Better, worse, unimaginably different?</p>

------------------------------------------
<p>
From the book:
</p>

<p>

> "Throughout much of his career, he led a double life: as an intellectual leader in the ivory tower of pure mathematics and as a man of action, in constant demand as an advisor, consultant and decision-maker to what is sometimes called the military-industrial complex of the United States. My own belief is that these two aspects of his double life, his wide-ranging activities as well as his strictly intellectual pursuits, were motivated by two profound convictions. The first was the overriding responsibility that each of us has to make full use of whatever intellectual capabilities we were endowed with. He had the scientist's passion for learning and discovery for its own sake and the genius's ego-driven concern for the significance and durability of his own contributions. The second was the critical importance of an environment of political freedom for the pursuit of the first, and for the welfare of mankind in general.
> I'm convinced, in fact, that all his involvements with the halls of power were driven by his sense of the fragility of that freedom. By the beginning of the 1930s, if not even earlier, he became convinced that the lights of civilization would be snuffed out all over Europe by the spread of totalitarianism from the right: Nazism and Fascism. So he made an unequivocal commitment to his home in the new world and to fight to preserve and reestablish freedom from that new beachhead.
> In the 1940s and 1950s, he was equally convinced that the threat to civilization now came from totalitarianism on the left, that is, Soviet Communism, and his commitment was just as unequivocal to fighting it with whatever weapons lay at hand, scientific and economic as well as military. It was a matter of utter indifference to him, I believe, whether the threat came from the right or from the left. What motivated both his intense involvement in the issues of the day and his uncompromisingly hardline attitude was his belief in the overriding importance of political freedom, his strong sense of its continuing fragility, and his conviction that it was in the United States, and the passionate defense of the United States, that its best hope lay."

-Professor Marina von Neumann Whitman, economist and von Neumann's daughter. Pages xv–xvi.

<p>

> "Oh, France won't matter."

-von Neumann's prewar thoughts on World War II
</p>

------------------------------------------

<p>

> "To conclude, I would like to mention that the importance of accelerating approximating and computing mathematics by factors like 10,000 or more, lies not only in that one might thereby do in 10,000 times less time problems which one is now doing, or say 100 times more of them in 100 times less time, - but rather in that one will be able to handle problems which are considered completely unassailable at present.
> I need not tell you that I shall be very gladly at your disposal at any time when you want more specific details about this subject"

-von Neumann to Commodore Louis L Strauss, on a proposal to build a computer in *1945*, page 236. I believe this computer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAS_machine. I wonder what he'd think of ChatGPT.
<p>

------------------------------------------

<p>

> "In principle, he reasoned, there was no reason why some day a machine might not be built which not only could perform most of the functions of the human brain but could actually reproduce itself, i.e., create more supermachines like it. He proposed to present this paper at Yale, where he had been invited to give the 1956 Silliman Lectures."

-Clay Bair Jr., in Life Magazine, 25 February 1957

That's von Neumann on artificial general intelligence and even AI takeoff/intelligence explosion/AI superintelligence, in *1956*!
</p>
------------------------------------------

<p>
von Neumann developed early computers specifically with the goal of building artificial general intelligence.
He was thinking about these things in the 1930s, including discussing them with Alan Turing.

> Shortly after, in 1935, von Neumann finds his way into the first line of the first sentence in 
 Turing’s first published paper: “In his [1934] paper ‘Almost periodic functions in a group,’ J. 
 v. Neumann has used independently the ideas of left and right periodicity. I shall now show 
 that these are equivalent.” Such a demonstration of Turing’s power of proof must have 
 caught von Neumann’s attention, for in 1937 he wrote a letter in support of a Princeton 
 fellowship for Turing, and in 1938 offered Turing a position as his assistant which, although 
 it paid $1,500 a year, Turing declined as the shadows of war lengthened in Europe.¹⁰

> (The admiration was mutual. In a letter written home from Princeton, von Neumann’s is the 
first name on a list of Princeton luminaries that included “Weyl, Courant, Hardy, Einstein, 
Lefschetz, as well as hosts of smaller fry.”)¹⁰

</p>

<p>
He was working heavily on computation in the 1940s, including via working on the design and construction of computers such as ENIAC, EDVAC, and the IAS machine.

The first of those, the ENIAC - is pictured below. Robert Oppenheimer stands next to von Neumann.
https://ananyo.substack.com/p/oppie-and-johnny-best-frenemies-of

About ENIAC:
> ENIAC  was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer, completed in 1945.
 There were other computers that had combinations of these features, but the ENIAC had all of them in one computer.
 It was Turing-complete and able to solve "a large class of numerical problems" through reprogramming.¹²

https://physicsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PW-2012-12-review-Campbell-Kelly-1.jpg
</p>

<p>
In other words, the ENIAC was the first real computer.
It fundamentally did everything a modern day computer does, and used the von Neumann Architecture.
That it was Turing-complete means it had the ability to do really any arbitrary computation, bounded only by hardware-level constraints.
</p>

<p>

<h4>The Silliman Lectures</h4>

> The Silliman Memorial Lectures, in honour of Hepsa Ely Silliman, are held at Yale University. They were funded by a legacy of 1883 left to the President and Fellows of Yale College. The College was requested to establish an annual course of lectures:
_... to illustrate the presence and providence, the wisdom and goodness of God, as manifested in the natural and moral world._
Each lecture course would be published in a series as a memorial to Mrs Silliman.⁶

> Von Neumann was invited to deliver the Silliman Lectures on _The Computer and the Brain_ in the spring of 1956⁶

<p>
The notes for the Silliman Lectures form the basis for Neumann's final book, also named [The Computer and the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Brain-Silliman-Memorial-Lectures/dp/0300181116).
</p>

<p>In 1955, a tumor was discovered near von Neumann's collarbone.
Cancer was then found elsewhere in his body.
In the spring of 1956, he checked into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as a cancer patient
He continued to work from his hospital room, including consulting with top military officials.³</p>

<p>von Neumann took with him to Walter Reed the manuscript he was preparing for the Silliman Lectures.
It was his singular professional focus during his final days.⁶
It was during that hospital visit at Walter Reed that von Neumann ultimately passed away, from bone cancer, in early 1957.</p>

<p>

> Towards the end, as cancer got hold of him and just before he received in 1956 a Medal of Freedom from President Dwight Eisenhower for his technical contributions to national defence, von Neumann asked in an article in Fortune magazine, "Can we survive technology?"
The article was naturally preoccupied with the destructive potential of more powerful weapons, faster computers and more rapid telecommunications.
But it presciently noted the climatic impact of rising carbon-dioxide emissions, too.
Von Neumann favoured introducing new geo-engineering technologies, which he thought would unite nations more than the threat of nuclear war.
Yet he accepted that there was no "complete recipe" for avoiding human extinction by technological means.
"We can specify only the human qualities required," he wrote, "patience, flexibility, intelligence."⁸
</p>

<p>Rest in peace Dr. von Neumann. We have the watch.</p>

To consider keeping:

The photo and a note from here about receiving the Medal of Freedom from Eisenhower: https://physicsworld.com/a/brilliant-polymath-troubled-person-how-john-von-neumann-shaped-our-world/

<p>Year ago, in the introduction to a college textbook for a course I took on Buddhism,
there was a description of a person (a historian, as I recall) looking at a Buddha statue.
The person remarked that, within thousands of years of very checkered human history, here is an idealogy (Buddhism)
that's unequivocally something of which we humans can be proud.</p>

<p>
In a world largely centered on negativity, I feel similarly about von Neumann's worldview and achievements: his life and work, both personal and professional.

<p>I used to work in Hamilton, New Jersey, a town not far from Princeton, New Jersey.
Princeton is nice. Nice restaurants, nice old-timey academic buildings.
The branding is stone of various hues - mostly brown and grey.
Beautiful. Have a look:

<p>When I'd visit Princeton, I'd go by John von Neumann's former home.<br/>

Here it is, at 26 Westcott Road:
