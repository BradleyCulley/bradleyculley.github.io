<b>
A poem I wrote for a poetry class in college, in 2009.
The name of the class was "The Writing of Poetry".
The title of the poem is "Superman to Superdog".
At the risk of sounding like a paper for an 11th-grade English class, I'll say that the poem explores themes of solitude, bravery, alienation, duty, family, love, and time.

Superman to Superdog<br/><br/>

He sits above me on a pillar<br/>
in The Fortress of Solitude.<br/><br/>

“Why a Fortress of Solitude”, I say,<br/>
"when you’re so alone, right now?”.<br/>
“Solitude is my nature”<br/><br/>

I’m stretched out below him,<br/>
amid the icy peaks.<br/>
I claw little furrows into the frost.<br/><br/>

“You could fight crime without the Superman costume, you know”<br/>
“Many things I can do here, Superdog.”<br/><br/>

“So then why?  Why play Clark?”<br/><br/>

He smoothes a wrinkle near his knee. He sighs.<br/>
“The Kent disguise allows me to be with the people.”<br/>
“The people?” I ask.<br/><br/>

“People don’t keep their firefighters<br/>
under their sinks”.<br/>
He looks down at me<br/>
the edges of a frown on that stony jaw.<br/><br/>

"Lois Lane knows this place, this 'Fortress'", I say.<br/>
"Truth, Justice...", he says quietly.<br/><br/>

“She’ll die, you know"<br/>
"You could fly her to the Rose Nebula,<br/>
but the trip would take a thousand years.”<br/><br/>

He snaps his eyes straight ahead. He begins, "My father, Jor-El, sent me to this planet. He gave me a mission…".<br/>
He trails off, perfectly still up there.<br/><br/>

It’s the speech: the only words from his parents.<br/>
He listens to it every night,<br/>
from the crystals.<br/>
