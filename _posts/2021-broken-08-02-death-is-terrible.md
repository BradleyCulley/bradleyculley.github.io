My favorite artist of any kind is Oumou Sangaré. She's a singer from Mali.

One of her songs is titled "Saa Magni", which means "Death is Terrible".
You can listen to it here: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_YyroDeZrY).

Include Saa Magni and Denis quote about when old people die it's like burning a library and include the mind uploading piece quote and include the dream I had about Wil Smith, a man I never met and hadn't thought about in probably 25 years or so

This photo of Bruce Lee in his casket that has really stayed with me: TODO add photo (https://i0.wp.com/.../2015/11/Brucelee11-Khurki.net_.jpg...).
All of that ambition and discipline and drive and talent and energy and character were permanently and simply gone, without reason.

I once heard someone say, speaking of mind uploading, that in the future we'll look back at the current era with astonishment.
In this era which we carried around something as precious as our entire mind in this biological vessel - subject to innumerable risks of complete loss.
We do better with our hard drives.

Nonexistence is perhaps especially incongruous and inexplicable when someone young dies so suddenly. 
Even more so when they're a great person, like Bruce Lee. 
Oumou Sangare has a song title that captures this well: [Saa Magna - "Death is Terrible"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_YyroDeZrY).

Rather than focus on the tragedy of his early death, perhaps it's best to focus on how thoughtful, deep, and self-disciplined he was — to be able to identify, and so profoundly fulfill such essential aspects of life in his short time on this planet.

"My parents died years ago. We were so close together. I still miss them so much. I know it will always be like this. I long to believe that their essence, their personality, what I loved so much about them, still really exists somewhere.
I wouldn't ask for much, just five or ten minutes a year, for example, to tell them about your grandchildren, to keep them up to date with the latest news, to remind them that I love them.
There is a part of me, as childish as it sounds, that wonders how they will be. "Is everything alright?" ", I want to ask. The last words I said to my father, at the time of his death, were: "Take care of yourself."
Sometimes I dream that I'm talking to my parents and suddenly, still immersed in the dream, the overwhelming realization that they didn't actually die, that everything was some kind of terrible mistake.
But here they are, alive and well, my dad doing an ironic face. Jokes, my mom seriously advising me to wear a scarf because it was cold. When I wake up, I go through a brief grieving process again. Clearly, there's something inside me that's ready to believe in life after death. And he doesn't care at all if there's any objective proof of it.
So I don't laugh at the woman who visits her husband's grave and talks to him from time to time maybe on the anniversary of his death. It's not hard to understand. And if I'm struggling with the ontological nature of who you're talking to, that's fine. That's not what it's all about. It's about human beings being human.
