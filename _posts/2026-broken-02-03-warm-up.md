<p>
As a young person listening to National Public Radio (NPR), I assumed that programs like "This American Life" were just "warming up" by dabbling around in stories like ones about someone setting up a tiny little indie theatre in a tiny little town; a tiny little town that used to revolve around having a shoe factory that employed everybody, and in which the shoe factory has since, sadly, closed.
</p>

<p>
I assumed once they got through the "warm-ups", they'd tackle the real stuff.
<ul>
    <li>Retroviral vector-based gene therapy</li>
    <li>The Riemann hypothesis</li>
    <li>American re-industrialization</li>
    <li>Biohacking, trans-humanism, longevity, cryonics, and immortality</li>
    <li>Sub-nucleonic structure (what's inside a quark?)</li>
    <li>Quantum electrodynamics, and more interestingly, quantum chromodynamics</li>
    <li>NP completeness, Gödel incompleteness</li>
    <li>Tuberculosis vaccines</li>
    <li>Structural violence, the preconditions of war, and unequal access to health care</li>
    <li>Quantum gravity</li>
    <li>Nucleosynthesis, inflationary cosmology, cosmic anisotropy, and baryogenesis</li>
</ul>
Some of which I knew of then, and some of which I became aware of later.
</p>

<p>
Turns out, I was wrong. The warm-up was eternal.

But then again, <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2436" target="_blank">that's what books, the internet, and university degree programs are for</a>.
