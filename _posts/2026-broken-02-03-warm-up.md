<p>
As a young person listening to National Public Radio (NPR), I assumed that programs like "This American Life" were just "warming up" by dabbling around in stories like someone setting up a tiny little indie theatre in a small town that used to revolve around having a shoe factory that employed everyone, in which the shoe factory, sadly, closed.
</p>

<p>
I assumed once they got through the "warm-ups", they'd start tackling the "real stuff":
<ul>
    <li>Retroviral-vector-based gene therapy</li>
    <li>The Riemann hypothesis</li>
    <li>American re-industrialization</li>
    <li>Biohacking, trans-humanism, longevity, cryonics, and immortality</li>
    <li>Sub-nucleonic structure (what's inside a quark?)</li>
    <li>Quantum electrodynamics, and more interestingly, quantum chromodynamics</li>
    <li>NP completeness, Gödel incompleteness</li>
    <li>Tuberculosis vaccines</li>
    <li>Structural violence, the preconditions of war, and unequal access to health care</li>
    <li>Quantum gravity</li>
    <li>Nucleosynthesis, inflationary cosmology, cosmic anisotropy, and baryogenesis</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Turns out, I was wrong.

But then again, it also turns out the real stuff is handled by <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2436" target="_blank">books, the internet, and university degree programs</a>.
