### Hypervigilance

People who are unnecessarily intense are usually both annoying and dangerous.

I've met many over the years.

A major clue is they're way too intense when you literally first meet them. I.e. a standard 'nice to meet you' situation.

In my experience, those folks almost always ended up having major personality/behavioral issues.

The clinical term is hypervigilance.

A common cause is traumatic life events. In a real sense, it's not the sufferer's fault.

But that's irrelevant when it comes to how I think is best to handle them: get as far away, in every sense, as possible.

A data point is I met exactly zero hypervigilant people in Sweden.
