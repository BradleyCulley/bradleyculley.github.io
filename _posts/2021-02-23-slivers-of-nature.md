<b>My father used to say places like the sliver of forest at the edge of a parking lot are somehow more wild than even deep in nature.</b>

<p>
From mid-2018 to early 2020, I lived in Northeastern Virginia.
A nice thing about Northeastern Virginia is the miniature parks one finds sprinkled through its suburban neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
One day, I chanced across a video of a person walking in a park in the rain, and the park randomly turned out to be right nearby.
The park is Pimmit View Park in Falls Church, Virginia, and this is the video (click to watch it in a new tab):<br/>

</a>

It's quite a pleasant film.
</p>

<p>
I walked the circuit just like in the video.
Part the magic was that, as you can see in the video, there are homes all around.
It was like a backyard tree fort: near to people, yet in another world.
</p>

<p>
I think a lot of people have a place like this: perhaps the courtyard where they take their lunch break, or their garden at home.
</p>

<p>
Another time, I walked through one of those Northeastern Virginia mini-parks with my father.
Looking back, it's perhaps no accident, but rather shared inclination, that that's what we did — rather than, say, going to a museum.

A few years before living in Virginia, I lived and worked in the Binghamton, New York area.
At a certain point, I found this park — "Canine Commons Dog Park": <a href="https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/10830" target="_blank">https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/10830</a>

<p>
It's a dog park, and I didn't have a dog, but I went anyway.
</p>

<p>
This is the entrance:
---todo add a photo of the entrance to the park--
The surroundings are wholly unremarkable, which somehow supported the feeling of divinity to it.
TODO: add photo of the entrance of the park.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
I found a small path from the park's main road to a stream just below. 
The stream was fairly hidden from the two roads that ran parallel to it on either side.
There's the highway on one side and the main road inside the park on the other:
TODO: add a screenshot showing the layout, with annotations from Google maps
</p>

<p>
At the stream, I'd often sit in a natural seat formed by the roots of a tree on the streambank.
I took this photo from that seat, or right nearby:<br/>

<br/>
I think the branches running across it are the branches of that tree.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
The streambed mesmerized me; the elegance of the rocks and the water.<br/>

</p>

<hr/>

<p>
At the streambed, you see a world of fractals: stones, leaves, patterns in the water.
</p>

<p>
A former coworker — who was from the area originally — once called Binghamton "a cesspool of drugs and debauchery", which is kind of funny, but he wasn't wrong.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
There's a certain aesthetic contrast of such a nice place being in such a troubled town.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, a sliver of nature involves a physical contrast.
There's the contrast between, say, the rear parking lot of a restaurant, with its loading dock and ventilation fans, and the quiet cluster of pines just beyond the asphalt.
