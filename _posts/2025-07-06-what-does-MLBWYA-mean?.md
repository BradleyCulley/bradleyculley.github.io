## <div align="center">What Does MLBWYA Mean?</div>

<p>
<b>MLBWYA, the title of this blog, stands for "May Love Be With You Always"</b>
</p>

<p>
A friend of my father sent me a card when I graduated from college.
He wrote a nice message in the body of the card, and on the signature line wrote "May love be with you always", and then his name.
</p>

<p>
The phrase burrowed into my mind.
When people have near-death experiences, otherwise deeply-impactful life events, and when, at the end of life, we're facing the prospect of non-existence, we tend to turn toward a need to experience true love. 
Therefore, MLBWYA seems to be a good summary of what matters most in life, and so I've made it the title of this blog.
