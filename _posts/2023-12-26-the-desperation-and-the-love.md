### The Desperation and The Love

<p><b>The United States is characterized by a deep sense of both desperation a sort of freewheeling love</b></p>

<p>Last year, I was at the ticket counter of the Stockholm Arlanda Airport in Sweden.
At one point, I saw a man step up to speak to the ticket agent at a neighboring ticket counter.</p>

<p>He was late middle-aged, dressed in business casual. Fairly well-groomed.
He set his backpack down at his feet and started pawing around in it - probably for a ticket or a passport.
He did so with a certain restrained franticness.
It was a franticness that, in my estimation, wasn't the result of, for example, being late for his flight. He just generally seemed harried and stressed out.</p>

<p>I'd perhaps not have taken notice of this, had it not happened in Stockholm Arlanda Airport.
One can spend all day in Sweden without encountering a frantic person.</p>

<p>I immediately thought "I bet he's American".
Sure enough, he stepped up and spoke with the ticket agent in English, with an American accent.</p>

<p>Someone I know, who's lived extensively in both Europe and the United States, once told me there's a sense of desperation among nearly everyone in the United States, even in wealthy neighborhoods. 
The reasons for that are a whole other can of worms, which I've written about to some degree, and will write more about later.
That's the desperation.</p>

<p>What about the love?</p>

<p>In mid-2022, I went to a gas station in Canton, Illinois.
Canton is a small town that's exactly like every other small town near it in Central Illinois.
It's flat, impeccable, and, to use a word I once heard to describe the Midwest, "expansive".</p>

<p>The card processing machines were broken.
The gas station clerks were both friendly and apologetic, but didn't seem the least bit distressed.
I got an iced coffee, made by adding ice to hot coffee, which, it turns out, was a dumb idea.
The clerk made some special dispensation on my behalf.
As I recall, she brewed a fresh batch of decaf.</p>

<p>By the time I left the gas station, we'd all been treated to one man's (semi-sad, but he was upbeat about it) life's story, involving injury and unemployment, as I recall.
The patrons - complete strangers - were chatting amicably amongst ourselves.</p>

<p>There's a particular kind of characteristically public, and characteristically freewheeling, love in The United States.
Dollar store employees hugging each other before one of them goes on break.
Tailgating. Dogs with their heads sticking out of the car window.</p>

<p>One can feel them both upon arrival in The US: the desperation and the love.</p>

<p>Years ago, I read a description of friendships in the Nordics versus friendships in Russia.
Apparently, friendships in Russia inevitably fall into a period of tribulation, for some reason or another, before ultimately emerging as an unbreakable bond, solid to the grave.  
Meanwhile, friendships in the Nordics have no such feature.</p>

<p>The author's theory was that, in Russia, you don't have a safety net in life, so your friend becomes your safety net.
The crucible of tribulation cements the bond to the level that's needed when your life depends on your friend.
In the Nordics, the government provides a safety net, so an auxiliary system is unnecessary.</p>

<p>I think the particular brand of freewheeling love in the United States is similarly compensatory.
Compensatory for the desperation.</p>
