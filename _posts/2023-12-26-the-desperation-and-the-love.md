### The Desperation and The Love

<p><b>The United States is characterized by a deep sense of desperation and a deep sense of a kind of hectic love</b></p>

<p>Last year, I traveled to Sweden. On the way out, I was at the ticket counter of the Arlanda International Airport, near Stockholm.
At one point, I saw a man step up to speak to the ticket agent at a neighboring ticket counter.
He was late middle-aged, dressed in business casual. Fairly well-groomed.
He put his backpack down at his feet and started pawing around in it - probably for a ticket or a passport.
He did so with a certain restrained franticness.
It was a franticness that, in my estimation, wasn't the result of, for example, being late for his flight, but rather just generally being kind of harried and stressed out.</p>

<p>I'd perhaps not have taken notice of this, had it not happened in Arlanda International Airport.
Why not? Because it was so out of place in Sweden. One can spend all day in Sweden without encountering a single frantic person.</p>

<p>Upon seeing him pawing in his backpack, I immediately thought "I bet he's American".
Sure enough, when he stepped up and spoke with the ticket agent, he did so in English, with an American accent.</p>

<p>Someone I know, who's lived extensively in both Europe and the United States, once told me there's a sense of desperation among nearly everyone in the United States, even in wealthy neighborhoods. 
The reasons for that are a whole other can of worms, which I've written about to some degree, and will write more about later.
That's the desperation.</p>

<p>What about the love?</p>

<p>In mid-2022, I went to a gas station in Canton, Illinois. Canton is a small town that's exactly like every other small midwestern town near it in Central Illinois.
It's flat, impeccable, boring, heavily-policed, and completely intolerant of any funny business.
The card processing machines were broken at the gas station.
The gas station clerks were both very friendly and very apologetic, but didn't seem the least bit distressed by the whole thing.
I got an iced coffee, made by adding ice to a hot coffee, which, it turns out, was a dumb idea.
The clerk made some special dispensation on my behalf - which I can't remember exactly, but I do remember as being very nice.
Perhaps brewing a fresh batch of decaf, or personally concocting the iced-non-iced coffee.
By the time I left, we'd all been treated to one man's (semi-sad, but he was upbeat about it) life's story, involving injury and unemployment, as I recall.</p>

<p>There's a particular kind of characteristically public, and characteristically freewheeling, love in The United States.
Dollar store employees hugging each other before one of them goes on break.
Tailgating; dogs with their heads stuck out the car window.</p>

<p>One can feel them both on arrival in The US: the desperation and the love.</p>

<p>Years ago, I read a description of friendships in the Nordics versus friendships in Russia.
Apparently, friendships in Russia inevitably fall into a period of tribulation, for some reason or another, before ultimately emerging as an unbreakable bond, solid to the grave.  
Meanwhile, friendships in the Nordics have no such feature.</p>

<p>The author's theory was that, in Russia, you don't have a safety net in life, so your friend assumes the role of safety net.
The crucible of tribulation cements the bond to the level that is necessary when your life may depend on your friend.
In the Nordics, the government acts as a safety net, so an auxiliary system is unnecessary.</p>

<p>I think the particular brand of freewheeling love in the United States is similarly compensatory.
A lot of things in the world of social dynamics are compensatory.
In this case, compensatory for the desperation.</p>
