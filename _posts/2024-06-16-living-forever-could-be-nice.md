### Living Forever Could Be Nice

  <div style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;">We've pushed up the average, but the end is stuck around 120¹</div>

Last summer, I was thinking about longevity research while driving around Maine looking at land for sale.

Below is a positive thought that came to mind.

-----
<p>
I think when we cure aging, it'll be emotionally similar to what people experience when they reach absolute financial freedom.
</p>

<p>
Years ago, I read about a woman who hit her financial freedom goal. The goal was something like a net worth of $7 million. 
</p>

<p>
She described it as an unbelievable feeling of joy, freedom, and lightness. She said that, if anything, the experience is underrated.
</p>

<p>
As with the old trope that "money isn't important", what we wish were true (that she felt nothing) couldn't be further from the truth.
</p>

<p>
Also interesting was what happened <i>after</i> she achieved financial freedom.
She said her wealth grew faster afterwards
She worked more in alignment with her personal missions, took more calculated risks, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Mark Cuban was once asked "What's the best thing about being a billionaire? The worst?"¹.
His answer was "Everything. Nothing."¹.
</p>

<p>
I think solving the ability to live as long as one likes will be similar.
I think the potential downsides, such as logistical problems, are oversold.
Humans are good at problem-solving...though usually only once the problem is looming.
</p>

<p>
Imagine if Eratosthenes, Euler, Edison, Einstein, Noether, von Neumann, da Vinci, Tesla, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel were all still alive and well today, each with a career hundreds or thousands of years long.
We might be Kardashev Type-II or Type-III already.
</p>

<p>
I also don't think the possibility of curing aging, of "longevity escape velocity", and so on is necessarily millenarian.
The image at the top of this post shows the anchoring effect humans currently experience: the maximum age is stubbornly anchored around 120 years.

There's been effective research in extending the lifespan of lab animals and, first the first time 2019, in humans². 
In a study lead by Dr. Greg Fahy, treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) [caused a net decrease of 2.5 years in the cellular age of participants](https://gwern.net/doc/longevity/epigenetics/2019-fahy.pdf)².
</p>

<p>
The anchoring around 120 years appears to be due to the Hayflick limit.
The Hayflick limit is the number of times a human cell can divide.³
Once you hit the limit, the cell stops dividing, the tissue starts to die, and so does the person.
It's like a candle burning through its wax.<br/><br/>

I think AI can help solve this.
</p>

<p>
Hydras, the small freshwater sea creatures, are cellularly immortal.⁴
<put the image here>

</div>
Hydras do not die of old age, and in fact do not age at all.⁴
They have an unlimited capacity to reset their cells to a "fresh" state.⁴<br/><br/>

"Research today appears to confirm Martinez' study.
Hydra stem cells have a capacity for indefinite self-renewal.
The transcription factor "forkhead box O" (FoxO) has been identified as a critical driver of the continuous self-renewal of Hydra."⁴
</p>

<p>
Hydras are proof that it's possible.
I think it'll be quite pleasant.
