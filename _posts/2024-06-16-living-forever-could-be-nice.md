### Living Forever Could Be Nice

Last summer, I was thinking about longevity research while driving around Maine looking at land for sale.<br/><br/>

Below is a positive thought that came to mind.
</p>

-----
<p>
I think when we cure aging, it'll be emotionally similar to what people experience when they reach absolute financial freedom.
</p>

<p>
Years ago, I read about a woman who hit her financial freedom goal. The goal was something like a net worth of $7 million. 
</p>

<p>
She described it as an unbelievable feeling of joy, freedom, and lightness. She said that, if anything, the experience is underrated.
</p>

<p>
As with the old trope that "money isn't important", what we wish were true (that she felt nothing) couldn't be further from the truth.
</p>

<p>
Also interesting was what happened <i>after</i> she achieved financial freedom.
She said her wealth grew faster afterwards
She worked more in alignment with her personal missions, took more calculated risks, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Mark Cuban was once asked "What's the best thing about being a billionaire? The worst?"².
His answer was "Everything. Nothing."².
</p>

<p>
I think solving the ability to live as long as one likes will be similar.
I think the potential downsides, such as logistical problems, are oversold.
Humans are good at problem-solving...though usually only once the problem is looming.
</p>

<p>
Imagine if Eratosthenes, Euler, Edison, Einstein, Noether, von Neumann, da Vinci, Tesla, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel were all alive and well today. Each would have a career hundreds, or thousands, of years long.
We might be Kardashev Type-II or Type-III already.
</p>

<p>
In longevity research, there's the idea of "longevity escape velocity": living long enough, or aging slowly enough, to "catch the train" of scientific progress such that one achieves immortality³.
"[I]n a given year in which longevity escape velocity would be maintained, medical advances would increase people's remaining life expectancy more than the year that just went by"³.
I don't think longevity escape velocity, the possibility of curing aging entirely, and so on, are necessarily millenarian.
</p>

<p>
The image at the top of this post shows the anchoring effect humans currently experience: the maximum age is stuck around 120 years.
However, there's been effective research in extending the lifespan of lab animals and, first the first time 2019, in humans⁴. 
In a 2019 study lead by Dr. Greg Fahy, treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) caused the cellular age of participants to be "approximately 1.5 years less than baseline after 1 year of treatment"⁴.
</p>

<p>
The anchoring around 120 years appears to be due to the Hayflick limit.⁵
The Hayflick limit is the number of times a human cell can divide.⁵
Once you hit the limit, the cell stops dividing, the tissue starts to die, and so does the person.
It's like a candle burning through its wax.<br/><br/>

I think AI can help solve this.
</p>

<p>
Hydras, the small freshwater sea creatures, are cellularly immortal.⁶

</div>

Hydras do not die of old age, and in fact do not age at all.⁶
They have an unlimited capacity to reset their cells to a "fresh" state.⁴<br/><br/>

"Research today appears to confirm Martinez' study.
Hydra stem cells have a capacity for indefinite self-renewal.
The transcription factor "forkhead box O" (FoxO) has been identified as a critical driver of the continuous self-renewal of Hydra."⁶
</p>

<p>
Hydras are proof it's possible.
And I think it'll be quite pleasant.
