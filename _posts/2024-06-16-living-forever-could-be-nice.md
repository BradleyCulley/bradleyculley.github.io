Was thinking about longevity research while driving around looking at land for sale last summer.

Below is a salient positive thought that came to mind about it.

I think when we cure aging, it'll be a similar emotional experience to the experience people have when they achieve absolute financial freedom.
I once read about a woman who hit her goal related to financial freedom. It was something like $7M in asset net worth. She described it as an unbelievable feeling of joy, freedom, lightness, etc. She said that, if anything, the experience is underrated.
Also interesting was what happens after she achieved financial freedom. She said her wealth grew actually grew faster afterwards. She was able to work on things completely aligned with her personal missions, take more calculated risks, etc.
Mark Cuban was once asked the best and worst parts of being a billionaire. His answer, now infamous: "best part: everything, worst part: nothing".
I think solving the ability to live as long as one likes will be similar.  I also think the purported downsides, such as logistical problems, are quite oversold. Humans are ingenious...we tend to solve big problems (often only right before the deadline). Also, imagine if Eratosthenes, Euler, Edison, Einstein, von Neumann, da Vinci, Tesla, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel were all still alive, healthy, and had careers hundreds or thousands of years long. We might be Kardashev Type-II/III by now.
I also don't think the possibility of curing aging, longevity escape velocity, etc. is necessarily millenarian. There's been effective research in lab animals and some verified age reversal in humans (https://gwern.net/doc/longevity/epigenetics/2019-fahy.pdf). I think AI, if properly aligned, will accelerate things. Hydras are cellularly immortal...so it's most likely possible.
