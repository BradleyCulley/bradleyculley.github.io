### Gödel Escher Technē

<br/><br/>
_Revised version of an essay I wrote earlier this year about some things that had been on the mind for a while_

I think the continued development of artificial intelligence will lead to an epistemic unraveling of teleological claims. There's been some of that already.

A while ago, I read a news article along these lines:

“Every year, a team wins the Super Bowl. That then leaves the deeper question: what's the point of winning the Super Bowl?"

If a machine can do everything a human can do, what's the purpose of a human doing anything? This is particularly important for domains previously considered the sole purview of humans. Work and relationships are under siege.

If not technē, is hedonia teleological? What about eudaimonia?

What about qualia in general? Specific quale, such as raising children?

What if an AI can raise children - expertly - according to a specification?

Are human endeavors teleological when a machine can replicate them, down through neuromorphic signal transduction?

It would be interesting if AI drove a renaissance in epistemology, teleology, and logos.

I think solutions will, as with the Super Bowl, be deontological. Consequentialism will be as good as gone.

More to the point, I think philosophy will be the final and most important area of human endeavor, whether or not we directly call it philosophy.
