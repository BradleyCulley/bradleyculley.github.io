"The ocean stirs the heart, inspires the imagination and brings eternal joy to the soul." –Robert Wyland

<hr/>

In 2023, I spent some time living in Hampton, New Hampshire, right near the ocean.

It's perhaps not well known that there's oceanfront in New Hampshire. There isn't much: a little strip of coastline.

***TODO add a picture of a map with the coastline highlighted**

Hampton, New Hampshire is one of the towns on that strip of coastline.
The short driveway to the first place I lived in Hampton was off a road that ran directly alongside the ocean.

The road was named "Ocean Boulevard".

The condo was a rear building, at the end of a parking lot, but only a few hundred feet from the ocean.
Less than a 60-second walk to be looking at the waves.

Everything about the condo was pleasant: the landlord, the condo itself, and the ocean.

I worked remotely and cooked a lot of pan-grilled chicken.

<p>
The trick was I rented it in the winter, so it was reasonably priced.
Most people don't go to the beach in cold New England winters.
</p>

<p>
I went for walks — usually at night — from the condo building, through the parking lot, out to Ocean Boulevard, and then along the seawall above the beach.
This photo I took shows the seawall:

Waves rolled in constantly from the horizon; breaking when they hit the sand, each crashing with a muted hiss.
</p>

<p>
Hampton was quiet at night. Not many people on the sidewalk by the seawall. A big sky over the ocean; rythmic crashing of the waves.

Later, I stayed for a while in another condo, also on Ocean Boulevard, but this time with a direct ocean view.
This is the view:

Henry David Thoreau wrote an entire book about walking.
<Add quotation from his book here, and elsewhere>

<Talk about the experience of working and looking over the ocean, Show the picture with my desk, put a note that all the photos are my own>
<mention that I don't have any complaints here - just felt like sharing>
<talk about grandma Nora and how she loved the beach>
<talk about how the brain naturally looks for problems, but not so much for serenity>
<talk about how Khalil Gibran used the ocean as a metaphor so much in his writing, and talk about how others have done the same, such as Sufi poets>
