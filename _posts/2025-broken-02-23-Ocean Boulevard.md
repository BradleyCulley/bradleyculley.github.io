"The ocean stirs the heart, inspires the imagination and brings eternal joy to the soul." –Robert Wyland

<hr/>

A few years ago, I spent some time living in Hampton, New Hampshire, right near the ocean.

It's perhaps not well known that there's oceanfront in New Hampshire. There isn't much: a little strip of coastline.

***TODO add a picture of a map with the coastline highlighted**

Hampton is one of the towns on that strip of coastline.
The short driveway to one of the places I lived in Hampton was off a road that ran directly alongside the ocean.

The road was named "Ocean Boulevard".

The condo was a rear building, at the end of a parking lot, a few hundred feet from the ocean.
Less than a 60-second walk to be on the beach listening to the waves.

Everything about the condo was pleasant: the landlord, the condo itself, and the ocean.

I worked remotely and cooked a lot of pan-grilled chicken.

<hr/>

<p>
The trick was I rented it in the winter, so it was reasonably priced.
Most people don't go to the beach in cold New England winters.
</p>

<p>
I went for walks — usually at night — from the condo building, through the parking lot, out to Ocean Boulevard, and then along the seawall above the beach.
This photo I took shows the seawall:

</div>

Waves rolled in from the horizon, breaking when they hit the sand. Each crashed with a muted hiss.
</p>

<p>
Hampton was quiet at night. Not many people on the sidewalk along the seawall. A big sky over the ocean, rythmic crashing of the waves.
</p>

<p>
I also stayed in a different condo on Ocean Boulevard, just down the road, this time with a direct oceanfront view.
The condo had a sliding glass window that opened to a balcony looking out over the ocean:

</div>

Beautiful.
</p>

<p>
I worked from a desk just off the righthand side of that photo.
Sometimes I'd leave the curtains open so I could turn my desk chair the side and see the ocean. 
</p>

<p>
Something I noticed, both from time spent sitting on that balcony and from the walks I took alongside the ocean, was how soothing the sound of the waves was.
Perhaps through some hardcoded circuits in the brain, it seems the sound of the ocean is naturally relaxing.
For the first time, I really understood why people pay such a premium for oceanfront real estate.
</p>

<p>
It was like a little jetpack of calm added to my mind.
Perhaps like going to a spa or relaxing for hours with a cup of coffee at a cafe, there's an effect of having — straightforwardly in a crazy crazy world — done something nice for yourself.
A sliver of pure, simple, harmless self-love.

We can often be quite hard on ourselves, especially among those of us who are conscientious and hard-working by nature.

<p>
Eventually, I moved on from Hampton to live elsewhere in New Hampshire, but a piece of Hampton stayed with me.

Henry David Thoreau wrote an entire book about walking.
<Add quotation from his book here, and elsewhere>

<Talk about the experience of working and looking over the ocean, Show the picture with my desk, put a note that all the photos are my own>
<mention that I don't have any complaints here - just felt like sharing>
<talk about grandma Nora and how she loved the beach>
<talk about how the brain naturally looks for problems, but not so much for serenity>
<talk about how Khalil Gibran used the ocean as a metaphor so much in his writing, and talk about how others have done the same, such as Sufi poets>
