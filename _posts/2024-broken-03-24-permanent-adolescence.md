Add an essay called permanent adolescence about permanent adolescence in American culture. Give the quote from the Ralph Nader. Mention that impression I had in college of international students I met who would just basically saw themselves as true full-blown adults in a way that even I would say many or perhaps even most actual middle age let's say American adults don't even don't even see themselves. Like they took themselves completely seriously they took life seriously etc. mention the Magnus midbow video.
