<b>My father used to say that places like the sliver of forest at the edge of a parking lot are somehow more wild than even deep nature</b>

Herzog likes to say, that “the world reveals itself to those who travel by foot.”

From email: It's so strange to arrive at that place where you have dreamed of. I remember writing the application in the evening beside a post office in Harpswell, ME, because there was a power outlet there. I had taken a bus there to go to a habitat site, but found out they didn't need volunteers, so planned to stay the night in the forest nearby (without supplies!). I remember walking down the road to a huge lake, which I tried to bathe in, but was salty. I also remember running barefoot to a huge park, which had a pier into the ocean, right near sunset. The buildings nearby were abandoned, and the glass was broken in. Though a long story short, I did get back there to build later in the month, but it was such a strange experience riding in a cab late in the night on the way to a hotel in Brunswick.
