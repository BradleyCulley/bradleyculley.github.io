### Solved and Unsolved

<p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">
        Some age-old problems are clearly unsolved<br/>
        Others are clearly solved, yet their solutions often ignored
    </h4>
</p>

Unsolved:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Success in romantic relationships</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Grappling with human mortality</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Free will versus determinism</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>The Riemann hypothesis</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Theodicy</b><br/>
        <p>"In the philosophy of religion, a theodicy is an argument that attempts to resolve the problem of evil that arises when omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and omniscience are all simultaneously ascribed to God."¹</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>The Fermi Paradox</b><br/>
        <p>There are billions of habitable planets in the universe, yet we've never observed intelligent life, or even life of any kind, elsewhere in the universe</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>How to build human-like artificial intelligence</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>How to effectively raise children</b><br/>
        A balancing act. Give them everything and they turn out badly. Give them nothing and they turn out badly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>What "human nature" is</b><br/>
        <p>
            Has anyone tried to fully solve this problem?
            "Here's human nature. It's a 25,000-page book".
            It doesn't seem an unreasonable ask. The connectome of the human brain is finite.
            The analogous discovery and synthesis for calculus happened about 350 years ago and hasn't changed since.
            It was a point of pride for my high school calculus teacher that what he was teaching was timeless and complete. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>How to make people be good</b><br/>
        Fixing classism, solipsism, the abuse of power, etc.<br/>
        Mountains of effort over the millennia. Countless moral systems.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>The Watchmaker Problem</b><br/>
        A watch is made by a watchmaker. The universe exists, so what created the universe?<br/>
        Why is there something rather than nothing? How could something come from nothing?<br/>
        The Big Bang is not an answer, by the way. The Big Bang just moves the problem.<br/>
        Nobody knows what caused the big bang, where the energy present at the start of the universe came from.<br/>
        Scientists don't know. Nobody knows.
    </li>
</ul>

Unsolved isn't unsolvable though

    More recently, another British scientist, Roger Penrose - a 2020 Laureate of the Nobel Prize in Physics - developed a theory called "Conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC)", which holds there have always been a cycles of Big Bangs and Big Crunches, since literally forever ago.<br/>
    The theory was popularized in Penrose's 2010 book "Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe".<br/>
    Penrose claims there's experimental evidence of CCC, in the form of rings present in the afterglow of the Big Bang.<br/>
    The afterglow of the Big Bang is known as the cosmic microwave background (CMB).<br/>
    This diagram from [test](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1140/epjp/i2013-13022-4?sharing_token=Gperu3fdOITR0zMEfPK_VosPkCdkOxEKPl2JoxdvwqF_JbG2hDZqlqnKgjgFWT-bXBCMgUzjxUWpJDnBU8tTTHMs_UIR_vcQidhgdw9WJFijFF8L3U5ij0qphf2TsREvm5_i4Rvun9ICBYQ_rkNpTD9XEEz1Ux_AO4E7gnZjMPQ%3D) shows the core idea - cycles of time⁵:<br/>

</p>
<p>
    The experimental evidence for CCC, and just CCC as a whole, are not widely accepted by the scientific community.<br/>
    Whether it's true or not isn't the point though. Penrose gave it a serious shot.
</p>
<p>
    German physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond famously declared "Ignoramus et ignorabimus".²
    That's Latin for "we do not know and will not know".²
    That's an ethos I sensed in literary studies, and in art in general for that matter: an elision of quantification.
    This is perhaps in part because of what would happen if you asked the average artist or poet "what's 600 divided by 15?", but I think it runs deeper in the type of mind that gravitates toward literature and the arts.
</p>
<p>
    In response to du Bois-Reymond's phrase, the famous German mathematician David Hilbert had this to say:<br/>
    "We must not believe those, who today, with philosophical bearing and deliberative tone, prophesy the fall of culture and accept the ignorabimus.<br/>
    For us there is no ignorabimus, and in my opinion none whatever in natural science.<br/>
    In opposition to the foolish ignorabimus our slogan shall be Wir müssen wissen – wir werden wissen ("We must know – we will know")."²<br/>
    Hilbert's tombstone bears that latter phrase:<br/>

    I've long been fascinated with problems like Fermat's Last Theorem.<br/>
    There's a certain gravitas to a problem unsolved since 1637.<br/>
    It has timelessness. There's a certain epistemic humility: "this isn't easy".
</p>

<p>
    This lens of thinking has helped me put various purported solutions in perspective.<br/>
    Did some dude just recently, in the year 2024, finally figure out how to have harmonious romantic relationships?<br/>
    And he's shouting-ly marketing it to you somewhere?
</p>

<p>
I think of these in contrast with problems that _are_ solved.<br/>
Ear infection? Take an antibiotic.

Solved:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Homelessness</b><br/>
        As of 2022, Finland had 3,686 people experiencing homelessness, with only 492 spending the night outside, in a country of 5.5 million people.⁶<br/>
        How did they do that? "The country has adopted a Housing First policy, whereby social services assign homeless individuals rental homes first, and issues like mental health and substance abuse are treated second."⁷<br/>
        The problem with programs that try to get people clean and healthy before giving them housing is that people in the situation of homelessness tend not to be in a state of mind, body, and life to successfully navigate administrative box-checking.<br/>
        Pretty simple solution really. The United States has 653,104 people experiencing homelessness.⁸<br/>
        Well over half a million, and a much higher per-capita rate, than Finland (and Sweden, etc.).<br/>
        Homeless people in The US also generally live in much more dangerous conditions than do homeless people in Finland.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Severe poverty</b><br/>
        Finland basically solved this too
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>"Poverty traps"</b><br/>
        The long-observed economic phenomenon of a spiraling into destitution that can happen below a certain level of wealth.⁹<br/>
        Your car broke down and you can't afford to fix it, so you can't drive to your job. Choosing between food and medicine.<br/> 
        Your problems compound. Finland.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Capitalism or Communism</b><br/>
        Finland again. Capitalism with a strong social safety net.<br/>
        Must we endlessly relitigate this?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Mass incarceration, recidivism</b><br/>
        Finland
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Arguably the root of all of the above: unequal access to opportunity</b><br/>
        <p>
            Finland. No less than the constitution of Finland makes it illegal to charge tuition for basic education (the definition of which includes college).¹⁰<br/>
            In other words, every school is funded exactly equally.<br/>
            There are some very minor exceptions to this, such as foreign-language schools.¹¹<br/>
            No "school districts".<br/>
            The flip side of "I bought an expensive house to be in a good school district" is that other children have to be in bad school districts.<br/>
            In other words, generational poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is also no sorting of students by ability level, and no exams until the age of 18.<br/>
            There's many a story in the US about a student getting miscategorized early in life, as learning disabled, behaviorally-flawed, or otherwise "defective".<br/>
            There are many stories in which it wasn't even the student's ability or behavior, but rather secondary factors such as a teacher with a grudge, various forms of bigotry, and so on.<br/>
            Problem solved.<br/>
            Within a first approximation, everyone gets a shot.<br/>
            In my opinion, this should be the bare minimum.<br/>
            No stifling of ability, nor forcing you into a specific job, nor other relics of communism, but an equal chance.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p> 
Paradoxically, I see more spirited debate about the solved problems than the unsolved ones.<br/>
We'll accept reductive answers about childrearing ("don't spoil them"), but argue to the ends of the Earth about capitalism.
</p>

<p>
I think that attitude misses potential in both directions.<br/>
The unsolved problems are so much more interesting, and the solved problems are so much more important.
