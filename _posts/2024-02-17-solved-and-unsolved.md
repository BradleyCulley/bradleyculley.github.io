### Solved and Unsolved

<p>

        Some age-old problems are clearly unsolved<br/>
        Others are clearly solved, yet their solutions often ignored

        <b>The Watchmaker Problem</b><br/>
        <p>A watch is made by a watchmaker. The universe exists, so what created the universe?
        Why is there something rather than nothing? How could something come from nothing?</p>
        <p>The Big Bang isn't an answer, by the way. The Big Bang just moves the problem.
        Nobody knows what caused the Big Bang - where the energy present at the start of the universe came from.
        Scientists don't know. Nobody knows.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
Unsolved isn't unsolvable though
</p>
<p>
    A number of years ago, British scientist Roger Penrose, a 2020 Laureate of the Nobel Prize in Physics, developed a theory called "Conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC)", which holds there have always been cycles of Big Bangs and Big Crunches, since literally forever ago⁴. The theory was popularized in Penrose's 2010 book "Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe". Penrose claims there's experimental evidence of CCC, in the form of rings present in the afterglow of the Big Bang, which is known as the "cosmic microwave background radiation".
</p>
<p>
    The experimental evidence for CCC, and the CCC theory as a whole, are not widely accepted by the scientific community.
    Whether it's true or not isn't the point though. Penrose gave it a serious shot.
</p>
<p>
    This diagram from one of Penrose's papers on CCC shows the core idea - cycles of time⁴:<br/>

      <div style="font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">Wrong, but kind of cool</div>
    </div>
</p>

<p>
    I've long been fascinated with problems like Fermat's Last Theorem. There's a certain gravitas to a math problem unsolved since 1637. It has timelessness. There's epistemic humility: "this isn't easy".
</p>

<p>
    This lens of thinking has helped me put various purported solutions in perspective. Did someone just recently, in the year 2024, finally figure out how to have harmonious romantic relationships?
</p>

<p>
I think of these in contrast with problems that <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> solved. Ear infection? Take an antibiotic.
</p>

Solved:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Homelessness</b>
        <p>
            As of 2022, Finland had 3,686 people experiencing homelessness, with only 492 spending the night outside, in a country of 5.5 million people.⁵
            How did they do that? "The country has adopted a Housing First policy, whereby social services assign homeless individuals rental homes first, and issues like mental health and substance abuse are treated second."⁶
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem with programs that try to get people clean and healthy before giving them housing is that people in the situation of homelessness tend not to be in a state of mind, body, and life to navigate administrative box-checking.
            A pretty simple solution: "Housing First".
        </p>
        <p>
            The United States has 653,104 people experiencing homelessness.⁷
            Well over half a million, and a much higher per-capita rate than Finland (and Sweden, etc.).
            Homeless people in The US also generally live in more dangerous conditions than do homeless people in Finland.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Severe poverty</b><br/>
        <p>Finland basically solved this too</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>"Poverty traps"</b>
        <p>
            The long-observed economic phenomenon of a spiral into destitution that can happen below a certain level of wealth.⁸
            Your car broke down and you can't afford to fix it, so you can't drive to work. Choosing between food and medicine. 
            Your problems compound. Finland again.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Capitalism or Communism</b>
        <p>Finland again. Capitalism with a strong social safety net. This need not be endlessly relitigated.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Mass incarceration, recidivism</b><br/>
        <p>Finland</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Arguably the root of all of the above: unequal access to opportunity</b><br/>
        <p>
            Finland. No less than the constitution of Finland makes it illegal to charge tuition for basic education (the definition of which includes college).⁹
            In other words, every school is funded exactly equally. There are some very minor exceptions to this, such as foreign-language schools.¹⁰
        </p>
        <p>
            No "school districts".
            The flip side of "I bought an expensive house to be in a good school district" is that other children have to be in bad school districts.
            In other words, generational poverty.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            There is also no sorting of students by ability level, and there are no exams until the age of 18.<br/>
            There's many a story in the US about a student getting miscategorized early in life...as learning disabled, behaviorally-flawed, or otherwise "defective".
            There are many stories in which it wasn't even the student's ability or behavior, but rather secondary factors such as a teacher with a grudge, bigotry, etc.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<br/>
<p> 
Paradoxically, I see more spirited debate about the solved problems than the unsolved ones.
It's common to accept reductive answers about The Fermi Paradox ("crop circles"), but argue to the ends of the Earth about capitalism.
</p>

<p>
I think that attitude misses potential in both directions.
The unsolved problems are much more interesting, and the solved problems are much more important.
