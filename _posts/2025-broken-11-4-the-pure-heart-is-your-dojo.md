In college, I trained with a Japanese Buddhist priest.
He used to tell me the Japanese saying "jikishin kore dojo", which means "the pure heart is your dojo".
A dojo is a traditional Japanese place of mental and physical training, a sort of refuge of strength.
Life can sometimes take from you everything other than being a decent person.
</p>

A story, from the book The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell, which I read on my own during the following year of college:
<blockquote>
The second story is of a different style. Tt is told of a young
prince who had just completed his military studies under a
world-renowned teacher.
Having received, as a symbol of his distinction, the title Prince Five-weapons, he accepted the five
weapons that his teacher gave him, bowed, and, armed with the new weapons, struck out onto the road leading to the city of his
father, the king. On the way he came to a certain forest.
People at the mouth of the forest warned him. "Sir prince, do not enter this forest,1
' they said; "an ogre lives here, named Sticky-hair; he
kills every man he sees."
But the prince was confident and fearless as a maned lion. He
entered the forest just the same. When he reached the heart of
it, the ogre showed himself. The ogre had increased his stature
to the height of a palm tree; he had created for himself a head as
big as a summer house with bell-shaped pinnacle, eyes as big as
alms bowls, two tusks as big as giant bulbs or buds; he had the
beak of a hawk; his belly was covered with blotches; his hands
and feet were dark green. "Where are you going?" he demanded.
"Halt! You are my prey!"
Prince Five-weapons answered without fear, but with great
confidence in the arts and crafts that he had learned. "Ogre,"
said he, "I knew what I was about when I entered this forest.
You would do well to be careful about attacking me; for with an
arrow steeped in poison will I pierce your flesh and fell you on
the spot!11
Having thus threatened the ogre, the young prince fitted to
his bow an arrow steeped in deadly poison and let fly. It stuck
right in the ogre's hair. Then he let fly, one after another, fifty
arrows. All stuck right to the ogre's hair. The ogre shook off'
every one of those arrows, letting them fall right at his feet, and
approached the young prince.
Prince Five-weapons threatened the ogre a second time, and
drawing his sword, delivered a masterly blow. The sword,
thirty-three inches long, stuck right to the ogre's hair. Then the
prince smote him with a spear. That also stuck right to his hair.
Perceiving that the spear had stuck, he smote him with a club.
That also stuck right to his hair.
When he saw that the club had stuck, he said: "Master ogre,
you have never heard of me before. I am Prince Five-weapons.
When I entered this forest infested by you, I took no account of

bows and suchlike weapons; when I entered this forest, I took
account only of myself. Now I am going to beat you and pound
you into powder and dust!" Having thus made known his determination, with a yell he struck the ogre with his right hand. His
hand stuck right to the ogre's hair. He struck him with his left
hand. That also stuck. He struck him with his right foot. That
also stuck. He struck him with his left foot That also stuck.
Thought he: "I will beat you with my head and pound you into
powder and dust!" He struck him with his head. That also stuck
right to the ogre's hair.'0
Prince Five-weapons, snared five times, stuck fast in five
places, dangled from the ogre's body. But for all that, he was unafraid, undaunted. As for the ogre, he thought: "This is some
lion of a man, some man of noble birth—no mere man! For although he has been caught by an ogre like me, he appears neither to tremble nor to quake! In all the time I have harried this
road, I have never seen a single man to match him! Why, pray,
is he not afraid"?" Not daring to eat him, he asked: "Youth, why
are you not afraid? Why are you not terrified with the fear of
death?"
"Ogre, why should I be afraid? for in one life one death is absolutely certain. What's more, I have in my belly a thunderbolt
for weapon. If you eat me, you will not be able to digest that
weapon. It will tear your insides into tatters and fragments and
will kill you. In that case we'll both perish. That's why I'm not
afraid!"
Prince Five-weapons, the reader must know, was referring to
the Weapon of Knowledge that was within him. Indeed, this
young hero was none other than the Future Buddha, in an earlier

incarnation."1
' "What this youth says is true," thought the ogre,
terrified with the fear of death. "From the body of this lion of a
man, my stomach would not be able to digest a fragment of flesh
even so small as a kidney bean. I'll let him go!" And he let
Prince Five-weapons go. The Future Buddha preached the Doctrine to him, subdued him, made him self-denying, and then
transformed him into a spirit entitled to receive offerings in the
forest. Having admonished the ogre to be heedful, the youth departed from the forest, and at the mouth of the forest told his
story to human beings; then went his way.32

It sounds like a platitude — "be good" — but there's more to it.

1. A decent person, not a caricature of virtue.
Talk about how both Mike Merritt the astronomy professor, and the ex-con interviewee said essentially the same thing when summarizing their life: I didn't do anything evil.
Note the tenor of that statement: it's not that they fasted and abstained from anything enjoyable, nor wandered the wilderness, nor studied or followed a particular religion.

It's a disservice to virtue to conceptualize it in a caricaturized way.
This is particularly true as it applies to young people.
I think well-intentioned aspects of organized religion can inadvertently push people away from virtue.
Thinking about the lives of famous saints in various religions, pretty much all of them sound, to be blunt, not super fun, especially if you're like 14 years old.
And yet the earlier you start being a decent person, the stronger the effect, in a disproportionate way.
2. An interesting take I once read is that the *external* mark of virtue is oddly specific: being <i>unassuming</i>. --TODO cite Chris Ebbert post about that
We've all met people like this: understated, doesn't take themselves super seriously, and an unshakeable aura of solidity and decency. The pure heart.
Pretty much every plumber I've ever was like this.
Another translation of "jikishin kore dojo" is "straightforward mind is the Dojo". -https://www.mountaincloud.org/straightforward-mind-is-the-dojo/
People like this are happy to join a round of drinks or go out dancing.
In fact they're quite the opposite of those who won't stop talking about their "spirituality" (😂).
3. The subtle shift that is everything: my experience.
Many years ago, and also in college, I experienced this firsthand.
In particular, I went from more of a "hmmm, am I the good guy here?" to a certainty that I was entirely decent.

4. This is Charles Ponzi, the person the "Ponzi scheme" is named after.
<blockquote>
While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not invented by Ponzi, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a "Ponzi scheme". His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his "investors" $20 million (equivalent to $237 million in 2024).
</blockquote> -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ponzi
I remember talking with someone about him, then looking him up and seeing that photo.
I remember thinking something like "wow, he just <i>looks</i> scummy".
Side note: Ponzi is introduced as a "charlatan and con artist" in the first paragraph of his Wikipedia article, which is kind of funny. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ponzi
5. Also applies to institutions, cultures, and countries. Ireland is, in my opinion, a good example of the power of the pure heart.
5Defense and offense. Defense: as mentioned above, protecting you in your most difficult hours. 
As the story of Prince Five-Weapons, being buffeted by the trials of the world. 
The quote from the sutras about the Buddha's eyes being like stars at the bottom of a well.
The ultimate "get everything taken from you" experience is of course death.
6. Self-sabotage is a real thing. I'm not a psychologist, but I think a real factor is one's sense of oneself.
While it doesn't always win in immediate decision-making, I think most people have a moral compass of some sort.
The key mistake is to think the compass isn't being applied <i>to you</i>, <i>by you</i>.
And the thing is, generally nobody has more control over you, than you.
Former CIA intelligence officer Andrew Bustamante recounted his experience - TODO fill in the detail of the story and add a citation.
Former Navy SEAL and famous ultramarathon runner David Goggins said "your mind has the ultimate tactical advantage over you" --TODO add citation.
If you don't, fundamentally, see yourself as someone decent, your mind will, in my opinion, tend to use that fact against you.
But the contrary is also true: thus the story of Prince Five-Weapons.

Henry David Thoreau had a nice turn of phrase in this regard:
<blockquote>
 Thoreau died of tuberculosis in the town of his birth, Concord, Massachusetts aged 44. When his aunt Louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with God, Thoreau responded: “I did not know we had ever quarreled.”
</blockquote> -https://www.holyhill.ie/saints-and-heros/henry-thoreau/

or maybe this quote:
<blockquote>
On his deathbed, Henry David Thoreau was asked by his aunt Louisa if he had made peace with God. “I did not know we had ever quarreled”, he replied.

His last words were, “Now comes good sailing.”

Offense: not to be dramatic, but this is kind of the "end goal" of a human life.
People have wildly different definitions of virtue, but virtue is still their goal.
Virtue is an awkward academic term, so you'll usually hear things phrased another way in everyday life.
You'll hear of the virtues themselves: "hard-working", "loyal", "generous", "family-oriented".

<p>
I trained for most of a year with that Buddhist priest, from the summer of 2008 through the spring of 2009. 
He had grown up in a Buddhist temple family in Japan, become ordained, and held multiple degrees in Buddhist studies, including one degree from Harvard University.
</p>

<p>
He conveyed that saying, "jikishin kore dojo" - "the pure heart is your dojo" with careful seriousness, many times.
He would, as I recall, generally say it in Japanese first and then in English, ensuring that I understood.
At the time, it didn't stick much in my psyche.
I saw it as another of the vague aphorisms sometimes wielded by the adults in my life.
These aphorisms often involved "leadership", which was in particularly vogue in my social milieu in the early 2000s. Think school principal speeches and baseball coach pep talks.

"The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough."
