hundred carts stood as full as ever.15'
The second story is of a different style. Tt is told of a young
prince who had just completed his military studies under a
world-renowned teacher. Having received, as a symbol of his

distinction, the title Prince Five-weapons, he accepted the five
weapons that his teacher gave him, bowed, and, armed with the
new weapons, struck out onto the road leading to the city of his
father, the king. On the way he came to a certain forest. People
at the mouth of the forest warned him. "Sir prince, do not enter
this forest,1
' they said; "an ogre lives here, named Sticky-hair; he
kills every man he sees."
But the prince was confident and fearless as a maned lion. He
entered the forest just the same. When he reached the heart of
it, the ogre showed himself. The ogre had increased his stature
to the height of a palm tree; he had created for himself a head as
big as a summer house with bell-shaped pinnacle, eyes as big as
alms bowls, two tusks as big as giant bulbs or buds; he had the
beak of a hawk; his belly was covered with blotches; his hands
and feet were dark green. "Where are you going?" he demanded.
"Halt! You are my prey!"
Prince Five-weapons answered without fear, but with great
confidence in the arts and crafts that he had learned. "Ogre,"
said he, "I knew what I was about when I entered this forest.
You would do well to be careful about attacking me; for with an
arrow steeped in poison will I pierce your flesh and fell you on
the spot!11
Having thus threatened the ogre, the young prince fitted to
his bow an arrow steeped in deadly poison and let fly. It stuck
right in the ogre's hair. Then he let fly, one after another, fifty
arrows. All stuck right to the ogre's hair. The ogre shook off'
every one of those arrows, letting them fall right at his feet, and
approached the young prince.
Prince Five-weapons threatened the ogre a second time, and
drawing his sword, delivered a masterly blow. The sword,
thirty-three inches long, stuck right to the ogre's hair. Then the
prince smote him with a spear. That also stuck right to his hair.
Perceiving that the spear had stuck, he smote him with a club.
That also stuck right to his hair.
When he saw that the club had stuck, he said: "Master ogre,
you have never heard of me before. I am Prince Five-weapons.
When I entered this forest infested by you, I took no account of

bows and suchlike weapons; when I entered this forest, I took
account only of myself. Now I am going to beat you and pound
you into powder and dust!" Having thus made known his determination, with a yell he struck the ogre with his right hand. His
hand stuck right to the ogre's hair. He struck him with his left
hand. That also stuck. He struck him with his right foot. That
also stuck. He struck him with his left foot That also stuck.
Thought he: "I will beat you with my head and pound you into
powder and dust!" He struck him with his head. That also stuck
right to the ogre's hair.'0
Prince Five-weapons, snared five times, stuck fast in five
places, dangled from the ogre's body. But for all that, he was unafraid, undaunted. As for the ogre, he thought: "This is some
lion of a man, some man of noble birth—no mere man! For although he has been caught by an ogre like me, he appears neither to tremble nor to quake! In all the time I have harried this
road, I have never seen a single man to match him! Why, pray,
is he not afraid"?" Not daring to eat him, he asked: "Youth, why
are you not afraid? Why are you not terrified with the fear of
death?"
"Ogre, why should I be afraid? for in one life one death is absolutely certain. What's more, I have in my belly a thunderbolt
for weapon. If you eat me, you will not be able to digest that
weapon. It will tear your insides into tatters and fragments and
will kill you. In that case we'll both perish. That's why I'm not
afraid!"
Prince Five-weapons, the reader must know, was referring to
the Weapon of Knowledge that was within him. Indeed, this
young hero was none other than the Future Buddha, in an earlier

incarnation."1
' "What this youth says is true," thought the ogre,
terrified with the fear of death. "From the body of this lion of a
man, my stomach would not be able to digest a fragment of flesh
even so small as a kidney bean. I'll let him go!" And he let
Prince Five-weapons go. The Future Buddha preached the Doctrine to him, subdued him, made him self-denying, and then
transformed him into a spirit entitled to receive offerings in the
forest. Having admonished the ogre to be heedful, the youth departed from the forest, and at the mouth of the forest told his
story to human beings; then went his way.32

In college, I trained for most of a year with a Buddhist priest. 
He'd grown up in a Buddhist temple family in Japan, become ordained as a priest, and held multiple degrees in Buddhist studied, including one degree from Harvard.
One of the things he would say to me is "Jikishin kore dojo", which means (roughly) "the pure heart is your dojo".

That is to say, the pure heart is your ultimate source of refuge and strength.
He repeated this saying to me many times.
